Writing this review after 2 days.The watch is great overall but lack 2 very basic features in my opinion.First is the always on display which could have been there since there is OLED display , it is just a software thing. I tried to find ways on the internet to turn on always on display but couldn't find anything.Second feature missing is the blood oxygen sensor which I feel should have been there given the price point. Even smart bands which costs 3k have blood oxygen sensor.Apple has reserved the above 2 features along with some other things as well for the premium watch models.Apart from the 2 features mentioned above , the watch is really great.Feels very premium on hand as does every other Apple product.The display is very smooth to touch and has rounded bezels which give a modern look.I'm a person who uses every Apple device such as Macbook , iPhone , iPad and Airpods along with apple services like apple music and stuff.So for me , this is the perfect watch.It is also my very first smart watch ever , so let me mention that learning the WatchOS was super easy.The interface is super smooth , no lags seen until now.The processor is fast and combined with the 32GB storage , it offers a great experience.One thing to know for the cellular model is that it only works with Postpaid sim.So if you have a prepaid sim , you either have to convert it into postpaid or get a new postpaid number.Works with both Airtel and Jio.But even without esim we can receive calls when the watch is connected to the phone through bluetooth.I have tested call quality and it's really good.The one thing which stands out in my whole experience is how good the haptics on this watch are.It feels like someone is poking you.It is totally different from vibrations.Believe me you'll love the haptics on this watch.Then moving onto fitness tracking , sleep tracking and heart tracking :I go to the gym everyday and so far it has measured my workouts very accurately.The heart rate sensor is also very good.And the sleep tracking is like 95% accurate , so near perfect.Another point to mention is that the integration with other apple devices is very good.Like your iPhone and Mac will automatically unlock if you're wearing the watch.And you can control music playing on Mac and iPhone through your watch.And , if you've received a notification on your watch and dismissed it , it won't appear again on your phone and vice versa.You can click photos on the watch using your phone's camera.You can even take screenshots on the watch and it will automatically get saved on your phone's photo application.The integration is just whole other level with this thing which no other watch can match.Regarding GPS , I haven't tried it yet.But it supports both Apple maps and Google maps , so don't worry about it.Regarding music , there is Spotify , Wynk Music and Youtube music for those who don't like Apple music.It even supports Microsoft apps like outlook for email , powerpoint , onenote , etc.There are a lot of third party apps which it supports and to be honest I didn't expect it to , so I'm very surprised.You can download a lot more apps from the app store as well.I haven't tested the battery extensively but it should last about 24 hours.Just like you have a habit of charging your phone daily , you'll have to charge this watch daily as well.I got this for 25.4k including all offers and discounts during Amazon Great Indian Festival.It is a good price but I could have gotten it for 22k if I ordered a few hours earlier.Amazon just increased the price within a few hours of the sale starting ðŸ˜’.

Â The Apple Watch SE is an impressive addition to Apple's lineup of smartwatches, offering a balance of affordability and functionality that makes it an enticing choice for those looking to enter the world of wearable technology. As a proud owner of the Apple Watch SE, I have found it to be a reliable and capable device that exceeds expectations in many ways.One of the standout features of the Apple Watch SE is its design. The watch maintains the iconic, sleek aesthetic of its pricier counterparts, featuring a crisp display and a choice of stylish aluminum finishes. The build quality is excellent, and the comfortable wristband ensures a secure fit throughout the day. Whether you opt for the classic look or experiment with vibrant bands, the Apple Watch SE effortlessly blends with any outfit or occasion.Despite being a more budget-friendly option, the Apple Watch SE doesn't compromise on performance. Powered by Apple's S5 chip, the watch operates smoothly and handles tasks with ease. Apps launch quickly, notifications are delivered promptly, and navigation is seamless. While it may not have all the cutting-edge features of the latest models, the Apple Watch SE offers a robust set of functionalities that cater to the needs of the average user.Fitness and health tracking are key strengths of the Apple Watch SE. With an array of sensors, including an optical heart rate sensor, accelerometer, and gyroscope, the watch provides accurate measurements of your activity levels, heart rate, and even blood oxygen levels. The built-in workout app offers a wide variety of exercise tracking options, ranging from running and cycling to swimming and yoga. The watch also motivates you to stay active throughout the day, with gentle reminders to stand up and move if you've been sedentary for too long.The watchOS ecosystem is where the Apple Watch SE truly shines. It seamlessly integrates with your iPhone, allowing you to receive and respond to calls, messages, and notifications directly from your wrist. The vast selection of apps available on the App Store expands the watch's capabilities, offering everything from productivity tools to entertainment and wellness apps. The ability to customize watch faces and complications adds a personal touch, allowing you to tailor the watch to your preferences and lifestyle.Battery life is respectable, easily lasting a full day with regular use. The watch charges quickly and conveniently, eliminating the need to fumble with cables thanks to its magnetic charging mechanism. However, it's worth noting that heavy usage, such as constant GPS tracking or playing music via Bluetooth, may lead to shorter battery life.In conclusion, the Apple Watch SE is a compelling option for those seeking a quality smartwatch without breaking the bank. It combines an attractive design, solid performance, and comprehensive health tracking features to provide an excellent overall user experience. While it may not have the latest advanced features found in higher-end models, the Apple Watch SE more than delivers on its promise of delivering a reliable and accessible wearable technology solution. Whether you're an entry-level user or someone looking to upgrade, the Apple Watch SE is an exceptional choice that offers incredible value for the price.
