This have the best display quality out of all nintendo switches

Very happy with the product and quick delivery!

Excellent product received as per schedule

This is my second nintendo console after the Gameboy color which i had way back in 2003..i switched to playstation after that due to availability of games in india.Coming to this console... I kept a track on its pricing for months i got this 27999 for V.R Games seller.. Make sure u choose this coz they are the official importers of the switch.. So i got for almost the same price as in US which is 350$-The packaging of the product was excellent. It was fully sealed wrapped in plastic and it had the official nintendo seal sticker so no complaints there-The console i received is from Singapore region so the charger is round tip which fits perfectly in Indian power outlets no need adapter.-the best part of this console is that vivid OLED display, the colour are vibrant and blacks are spot on.- the battery depends on the types of games u play. I got aroun 3:30min playin assassins creed black flag.. And almost 4:30 min on playing pokemon brilliant diamond. Both games wer played at 50% brightness.- it runs at 720p on handheld mode.. But once its docked it goes to 1080p.. 720p on the oled screen looks great.Some tips-install a tempered screen protector immediately.. This screen gets scratches easily.. I have used the spigen screen protector it comes with an easy applicator.-if you want to use the Eshop create a nintendo account on the nintendo website on ur pc or mobile and in edit profile set your region to America.. Choose any state.-link ur debit card to paypal to purchase online. I hav a canara bank card which is linked to paypal and it works on the Eshop.

Good genuine product

In other reviews as well as in the product photos the red and blue color are dark but for me, they are like neon red (which is kind of pinkish) but the blue is kinda of close enough as it should be, really disappointed with the red color, if I had known this would happen then I would have purchased the white one only, please look forwardto this. Other then that the games are pretty smooth and a lot of free games

Nice crisp OLED displayAwesome games

If you have played mario in the eighties and the nineties and liked it, just go for it if you can afford it. Forget the reviews, forget the endless youtubers comparing the graphics capabilities of consoles, what matters is what you want to play on the console. If it is mario and the likes, just go for it. You cannot play it on any other console with whatever it's capabilities are !!Also if you want to enjoy gaming yourselves and with kids, nintendo switch is the most kid friendly console. You will struggle to find non 18+ games for xbox and ps5. Also as Nintendo is the oldest gaming and console company around, the console and controller are bug free and never hangs or disconnect. My earlier xbox controller is so useless that it keeps disconnecting due to the vibrations of the haptic feedback itself, that I had to disable vibrations in order to use it. It still keeps disconnecting.Only affordability and price of games is an issue here. So if you have money to throw away, go for it otherwise save your money and wait for the prices to come down.
