the iPhone 14s on paper should have thebest battery life we've ever seen on aniPhone so given that their last 13 ProMax already broke the record for thelongest time to ever survive one of mybattery tests yes I'm excited about thisso on the table right now is pretty muchevery phone Apple currently sells the 14pro Max the 14 pro the standard 14 theiPhone 13 and 30 mini the iPhone 12 andthen finally the iPhone SE I've just setall phones to an equivalent level ofbrightness and I've literally gone andbought a brand new version of each onejust to make sure that every singledevice on this table has 100 batteryhealth so let's just unplug and get thisstarted because I've got very mixedexpectations about these iPhones on onehand all signs point towards the normaliPhone 14 being very similar to thenormal iPhone 13. not just in terms ofbattery but also the chipset it's beingpowered by the display technology that'sbeing used it almost seems like a reskinof the same phone but then if we lookacross at the iPhone 14 Pros big changesnot only do they have a next-gen a16bionic chip but also have a new type ofdisplay panel which for other phones hasbeen a game changer for battery lifelike to the point where I am low-keyscared because last time I run one ofthese tests the phone lasted so longthat I only managed to get four hours ofsleep so so far after 30 minutes it iskind of cool that you can already seethe new phones start to create a leadthe 14 pro Max is still on 99 and the 14pro and the 14 they're not too farbehind either the SE though is all theway down on 90 so has apparently lost 10times the amount of battery that the 14pro Max has you might have realized thatthe one device that we don't have justyet is the iPhone 14 plus because itcomes out later which is kind of a shamebecause it is a photo that Apple sayingwill have incredible battery life butthe good news is that because of howsimilarities to the normal iPhone 14 inevery other spec apart from battery sizewe will actually be able to closelyextrapolate its battery life by the endof the test it's hard to say what I'mexpecting at this point from the iPhone14s because the battery life on my 13Pro Max was absolutely Stellar when Ifirst got it like genuinely so good thatI was sometimes finishing days with 40left and so it doesn't feel like a veryApple thing to do to make it even betterthis company is not in the business oftrying to cater to the niche one percentof users for who battery life was alimiting factor on that phone but thenequally the other thing that I'venoticed on my 13 Pro Max is that oneyear on the battery life has fallenquite significantly it's not quite thethe make it through anything hero thatthe phone once was and so some part ofme is still hoping that the 14 pro Maxcan take battery life another stepfurther to just guarantee that batterycapacity over its entire lifespan so farit's looking possible after an hour anda half the 14 Pros are starting toseparate from the rest of the pack butstill very healthy levels of charge leftit's anyone you have all the phones sathere on the same table at the same timethat you realize how much moreaesthetically pleasing Apple's new holepunch camera is well equally howoutdated the notch on the other phone'slooks the screen borders are alsothinner than ever on the 14 Pros whichis a difference that I've been reallystruggling to notice until I startedrecording this battery test you can seeif you compare the the left hand sidebezel of the 14 pro with the left handside bezel at the 14 a subtle differencebut it is one of my favorite things tosee get upgraded alright two hours nowthe pros are comfortably ahead and thisis where I was expecting them to startto creep further ahead because we canplay some games up until this point allof these phones chipsets have beenfairly idle but these games will pushthem to work hard and this shouldhighlight any efficiency games thatApple's made with it for the last fewgenerations of chips Apple has beenheavily focused not on Pure Performancethey've almost taken it as a given thatthey're already ahead in that but moreon performance per watt of powerconsumed and the result of that shouldbe a set of increasingly streamlinedchips that each draw less power than thelast while performing the same task thatsaid it doesn't seem like a world ofdifference like the iPhone 12 with itstwo generation old A14 bionic chip itdoesn't just suddenly start losingbattery way faster than the 14 Proswhich are running the New a16 Monic it'sa subtle upgrade a lot of this is downto the way it's marketed to us like whena company announces a brand new chip andthey say it has 15 more performance perwatt than last year it kind of makes youthink well I'm gonna get 15 more batterylife on top of all all the other greatperformance improvements they promisedtoo but then you realize not only willthat 15 be a hand selected best keyscenario figure but also it does infactor in that if you're dialing up theperformance at the same time then evenif your performance per watt is going upyou may still end up drawing just asmuch power if not more than lastgeneration but this is the iPhone 14Pro's second chance to completely pullahead of everyone elseinternet browsing because here's thething the new display Tech on the 14Pros lets them scale their refresh rateall the way down from the peak of 120hertz to just one Hertz now if you'relooking at something static and I wasconvinced that this was going to be thenail in the coffin for every other phoneif you remember last year's iPhone 13Pros they had the option to scale theirrefresh rates from 120 hertz all the waydown to 10 Hertz and even that wasawesome for battery life it basicallyallowed you to have a display that feltsuper smooth at 120 hertz with none ofthe battery life hit that usually camewith that smoothness so surely the factthat these new phones can go down evenfurther to just one Hertz is going tostop power consumption in its trackswhen you're just looking at non-movingwebsite Pages not really because forsome reason Apple has restricted the useof the one Hertz refresh rate just tothe always-on display that you now getwhen you turn your phone off and don'tget me wrong that is a great new featurebut it's kind of a shame that they'vebuilt the hardware that we know iscapable of some extreme power savingsbut then not allowed you to fullycapital eyes on that like some otherphones have and now just before we hitthe five hour mark the iPhone SE on thefar right has decided to say it'sgoodbyes this is not what I'd call astrong position to be in and actuallywhile we're at it if you're consideringbuying one of these iPhones my advice isdon't buy the SE if you've got 429dollars to spend on a phone you can geta far better experience with a Googlepixel than nothing firm one 5.99 for theiPhone 12 is better but still nottremendous value either considering thatthat's two year old Tech and that itwasn't exactly bleeding edge even whenit was launched but the iPhone 13 miniand upwards they make sense they're morepowerful they've got better battery lifefor their respective sizes bettercameras they're going to get updates forlonger what I'm saying is that I thinkthe 13 mini is the lowest end iPhoneyou'd need to buy to get a good 2022 iOSexperience okay it is pretty safe to sayat this point that I'm going to losesome sleep tonight look at this Pro Maxit's still in its 40s after over fivehours then has also now separated itselffrom the normal 14 pro which is initself a tier above the base 14. by mynormal battery benchmarks of five hoursbeing just about good enough six beingvery good seven being above and beyondand anything over eight being incredibleit's looking like the 14 pro Max isgoing to be well beyond that and theiPhone 14 plus that we're going toestimate is also looking very strongindeed based on how the 14 is doing solet's fast forward this test and get tothe results to find out if they do thatbear in Mind by the way that on thistest every phone has had Wi-Fi onBluetooth on brightness matched to eachother but on the high side they're allon light mode and the speakers are setto 50 volume so if anything this isprobably slightly more intense than anormal day and if you're conscious aboutyour battery you could make each one ofthese phones last longer than it isdoing right now but then on the flipside this test doesn't account for anybattery that you might lose while yourphone is on standby in between whenyou're using it but thankfully thatdoesn't change much because iPhones tendto lose very little when not in use andthat leads us to the results so ineighth place at Just 4 hours 52 minutesiPhone SE the only time that I wouldrecommend this phone is if you were acompletely sold on having a physicalhome button and never wanted to learnfull screen gestures be willing to havea very small screen and a basic cameraand then see on not a big social mediauser

of a shamebecause it is a photo that Apple sayingwill have incredible battery life butthe good news is that because of howsimilarities to the normal iPhone 14 inevery other spec apart from battery sizewe will actually be able to closelyextrapolate its battery life by the endof the test it's hard to say what I'mexpecting at this point from the iPhone14s because the battery life on my 13Pro Max was absolutely Stellar when Ifirst got it like genuinely so good thatI was sometimes finishing days with 40left and so it doesn't feel like a veryApple thing to do to make it even betterthis company is not in the business oftrying to cater to the niche one percentof users for who battery life was alimiting factor on that phone but thenequally the other thing that I'venoticed on my 13 Pro Max is that oneyear on the battery life has fallenquite significantly it's not quite thethe make it through anything hero thatthe phone once was and so some part ofme is still hoping that the 14 pro Maxcan take battery life another stepfurther to just guarantee that batterycapacity over its entire lifespan so farit's looking possible after an hour anda half the 14 Pros are starting toseparate from the rest of the pack butstill very healthy levels of charge leftit's anyone you have all the phones sathere on the same table at the same timethat you realize how much moreaesthetically pleasing Apple's new holepunch camera is well equally howoutdated the notch on the other phone'slooks the screen borders are alsothinner than ever on the 14 Pros whichis a difference that I've been reallystruggling to notice until I startedrecording this battery test you can seeif you compare the the left hand sidebezel of the 14 pro with the left handside bezel at the 14 a subtle differencebut it is one of my favorite things tosee get upgraded alright two hours nowthe pros are comfortably ahead and thisis where I was expecting them to startto creep further ahead because we canplay some games up until this point allof these phones chipsets have beenfairly idle but these games will pushthem to work hard and this shouldhighlight any efficiency games thatApple's made with it for the last fewgenerations of chips Apple has beenheavily focused not on Pure Performancethey've almost taken it as a given thatthey're already ahead in that but moreon performance per watt of powerconsumed and the result of that shouldbe a set of increasingly streamlinedchips that each draw less power than thelast while performing the same task thatsaid it doesn't seem like a world ofdifference like the iPhone 12 with itstwo generation old A14 bionic chip itdoesn't just suddenly start losingbattery way faster than the 14 Proswhich are running the New a16 Monic it'sa subtle upgrade a lot of this is downto the way it's marketed to us like whena company announces a brand new chip andthey say it has 15 more performance perwatt than last year it kind of makes youthink well I'm gonna get 15 more batterylife on top of all all the other greatperformance improvements they promisedtoo but then you realize not only willthat 15 be a hand selected best keyscenario figure but also it does infactor in that if you're dialing up theperformance at the same time then evenif your performance per watt is going upyou may still end up drawing just asmuch power if not more than lastgeneration but this is the iPhone 14Pro's second chance to completely pullahead of everyone elseinternet browsing because here's thething the new display Tech on the 14Pros lets them scale their refresh rateall the way down from the peak of 120hertz to just one Hertz now if you'relooking at something static and I wasconvinced that this was going to be thenail in the coffin for every other phoneif you remember last year's iPhone 13Pros they had the option to scale theirrefresh rates from 120 hertz all the waydown to 10 Hertz and even that wasawesome for battery life it basicallyallowed you to have a display that feltsuper smooth at 120 hertz with none ofthe battery life hit that usually camewith that smoothness so surely the factthat these new phones can go down evenfurther to just one Hertz is going tostop power consumption in its trackswhen you're just looking at non-movingwebsite Pages not really because forsome reason Apple has restricted the useof the one Hertz refresh rate just tothe always-on display that you now getwhen you turn your phone off and don'tget me wrong that is a great new featurebut it's kind of a shame that they'vebuilt the hardware that we know iscapable of some extreme power savingsbut then not allowed you to fullycapital eyes on that like some otherphones have and now just before we hitthe five hour mark the iPhone SE on thefar right has decided to say it'sgoodbyes this is not what I'd call astrong position to be in and actuallywhile we're at it if you're consideringbuying one of these iPhones my advice isdon't buy the SE if you've got 429dollars to spend on a phone you can geta far better experience with a Googlepixel than nothing firm one 5.99 for theiPhone 12 is better but still nottremendous value either considering thatthat's two year old Tech and that itwasn't exactly bleeding edge even whenit was launched but the iPhone 13 miniand upwards they make sense they're morepowerful they've got better battery lifefor their respective sizes bettercameras they're going to get updates forlonger what I'm saying is that I thinkthe 13 mini is the lowest end iPhoneyou'd need to buy to get a good 2022 iOSexperience okay it is pretty safe to sayat this point that I'm going to losesome sleep tonight look at this Pro Maxit's still in its 40s after over fivehours then has also now separated itselffrom the normal 14 pro which is initself a tier above the base 14. by mynormal battery benchmarks of five hoursbeing just about good enough six beingvery good seven being above and beyondand anything over eight being incredibleit's looking like the 14 pro Max isgoing to be well beyond that and theiPhone 14 plus that we're going toestimate is also looking very strongindeed based on how the 14 is doing solet's fast forward this test and get tothe results to find out if they do thatbear in Mind by the way that on thistest every phone has had Wi-Fi onBluetooth on brightness matched to eachother but on the high side they're allon light mode and the speakers are setto 50 volume so if anything this isprobably slightly more intense than anormal day and if you're conscious aboutyour battery you could make each one ofthese phones last longer than it isdoing right now but then on the flipside this test doesn't account for anybattery that you might lose while yourphone is on standby in between whenyou're using it but thankfully thatdoesn't change much because iPhones tendto lose very little when not in use andthat leads us to the results so ineighth place at Just 4 hours 52 minutesiPhone SE the only time that I wouldrecommend this phone is if you were acompletely sold on having a physicalhome button and never wanted to learnfull screen gestures be willing to havea very small screen and a basic cameraand then see on not a big social mediauser for anyone who spends even a coupleof hours a day on YouTube or Instagramthat will be half your battery gone thenin seventh surviving a landslide longerthan that we have the iPhone 13 mini andthis phone is good I would recommend itbut only if you are specificallysearching for a small phone assumingthat you are then there are very fewthat have managed to achieve thisshrinking with such little compromisebut if you're not then you can get muchbetter battery life going for thefull-size iPhone 30. the 12 is nextthough but close enough to the 13 minithat it's give or take it's roughlyequivalent between them which given thatthis phone also doesn't have the benefitof being tiny like the 30 mini doesn'treally have a place in my books funnilyenough next up was not the iPhone 13 butactually the iPhone 14 Landing in at 7hours and 13 minutes I wouldn't takethat defeat too seriously they don'tneed loss to the iPhone 13 by around 2minutes and the battery life is alreadyin a very comfortable place the reasonyou would get an iPhone 14 over aniPhone 13 is not really extra batterylife it's primarily cameras really ithas better front camera and a better setof rear cameras so then that's 7 hours15 Good Old Reliable iPhone 13. firmlyin the above and beyond category and Iknow tons of people with iPhone 13s andpretty much the top comments that I getfrom these people is that battery lifeis good in it yeah that's what myfriends sound likethis is probably the closest I've everbeen to recommending last year's phoneover this year's photo but yeah I meanyou can take this as reassurance thatthe iPhone 13 is still a good purchasein late 2022. third place though is abig jump iPhone 14 pro with 7 hours and49 minutes even with a similar sizedbody and a similar sized battery thisfan managed to last a full 35 minuteslonger than the base 14. thoroughlyimpressed with this phone and not justthe battery the cameras too my fullcamera test is linked Below in case youwant to see it but now we have the Rogueone at this point I can tell you with afairly High degree of certainty that thenumber two best battery life in a testlike this will actually belong to theiPhone 14 plus given that the iPhone 14lasted 7 hours 13 and that Apple's owntesting has found that the 14 plus hasan extra 30 battery life lead on the 14that would place this phone at around 9hours 23 if we run it through the samesituation to have 30 more battery lifethan the base 14 makes this a verytempting phone in my books but at thesame time it's actually sad because Idon't imagine it's going to sell toowell now that leads us with first theiPhone 14 pro Max at 9 hours and 31.it's not mind-blowing it's actuallyslightly worse performance than the 13Pro Max but nonetheless this is still onthe top shelf of what currentsmartphones have to offer anotherinteresting note regarding apple is thatit seems like as well as phones they'realso slowly but surely becoming an adbusiness over the last few years they'vestarted cracking down on how othercompanies like meta are allowed toadvertise to iPhone users then it turnsout that's because Apple wants toadvertise to iPhone users within theirown Apple apps
