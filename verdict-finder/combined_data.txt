the iPhone 14s on paper should have thebest battery life we've ever seen on aniPhone so given that their last 13 ProMax already broke the record for thelongest time to ever survive one of mybattery tests yes I'm excited about thisso on the table right now is pretty muchevery phone Apple currently sells the 14pro Max the 14 pro the standard 14 theiPhone 13 and 30 mini the iPhone 12 andthen finally the iPhone SE I've just setall phones to an equivalent level ofbrightness and I've literally gone andbought a brand new version of each onejust to make sure that every singledevice on this table has 100 batteryhealth so let's just unplug and get thisstarted because I've got very mixedexpectations about these iPhones on onehand all signs point towards the normaliPhone 14 being very similar to thenormal iPhone 13. not just in terms ofbattery but also the chipset it's beingpowered by the display technology that'sbeing used it almost seems like a reskinof the same phone but then if we lookacross at the iPhone 14 Pros big changesnot only do they have a next-gen a16bionic chip but also have a new type ofdisplay panel which for other phones hasbeen a game changer for battery lifelike to the point where I am low-keyscared because last time I run one ofthese tests the phone lasted so longthat I only managed to get four hours ofsleep so so far after 30 minutes it iskind of cool that you can already seethe new phones start to create a leadthe 14 pro Max is still on 99 and the 14pro and the 14 they're not too farbehind either the SE though is all theway down on 90 so has apparently lost 10times the amount of battery that the 14pro Max has you might have realized thatthe one device that we don't have justyet is the iPhone 14 plus because itcomes out later which is kind of a shamebecause it is a photo that Apple sayingwill have incredible battery life butthe good news is that because of howsimilarities to the normal iPhone 14 inevery other spec apart from battery sizewe will actually be able to closelyextrapolate its battery life by the endof the test it's hard to say what I'mexpecting at this point from the iPhone14s because the battery life on my 13Pro Max was absolutely Stellar when Ifirst got it like genuinely so good thatI was sometimes finishing days with 40left and so it doesn't feel like a veryApple thing to do to make it even betterthis company is not in the business oftrying to cater to the niche one percentof users for who battery life was alimiting factor on that phone but thenequally the other thing that I'venoticed on my 13 Pro Max is that oneyear on the battery life has fallenquite significantly it's not quite thethe make it through anything hero thatthe phone once was and so some part ofme is still hoping that the 14 pro Maxcan take battery life another stepfurther to just guarantee that batterycapacity over its entire lifespan so farit's looking possible after an hour anda half the 14 Pros are starting toseparate from the rest of the pack butstill very healthy levels of charge leftit's anyone you have all the phones sathere on the same table at the same timethat you realize how much moreaesthetically pleasing Apple's new holepunch camera is well equally howoutdated the notch on the other phone'slooks the screen borders are alsothinner than ever on the 14 Pros whichis a difference that I've been reallystruggling to notice until I startedrecording this battery test you can seeif you compare the the left hand sidebezel of the 14 pro with the left handside bezel at the 14 a subtle differencebut it is one of my favorite things tosee get upgraded alright two hours nowthe pros are comfortably ahead and thisis where I was expecting them to startto creep further ahead because we canplay some games up until this point allof these phones chipsets have beenfairly idle but these games will pushthem to work hard and this shouldhighlight any efficiency games thatApple's made with it for the last fewgenerations of chips Apple has beenheavily focused not on Pure Performancethey've almost taken it as a given thatthey're already ahead in that but moreon performance per watt of powerconsumed and the result of that shouldbe a set of increasingly streamlinedchips that each draw less power than thelast while performing the same task thatsaid it doesn't seem like a world ofdifference like the iPhone 12 with itstwo generation old A14 bionic chip itdoesn't just suddenly start losingbattery way faster than the 14 Proswhich are running the New a16 Monic it'sa subtle upgrade a lot of this is downto the way it's marketed to us like whena company announces a brand new chip andthey say it has 15 more performance perwatt than last year it kind of makes youthink well I'm gonna get 15 more batterylife on top of all all the other greatperformance improvements they promisedtoo but then you realize not only willthat 15 be a hand selected best keyscenario figure but also it does infactor in that if you're dialing up theperformance at the same time then evenif your performance per watt is going upyou may still end up drawing just asmuch power if not more than lastgeneration but this is the iPhone 14Pro's second chance to completely pullahead of everyone elseinternet browsing because here's thething the new display Tech on the 14Pros lets them scale their refresh rateall the way down from the peak of 120hertz to just one Hertz now if you'relooking at something static and I wasconvinced that this was going to be thenail in the coffin for every other phoneif you remember last year's iPhone 13Pros they had the option to scale theirrefresh rates from 120 hertz all the waydown to 10 Hertz and even that wasawesome for battery life it basicallyallowed you to have a display that feltsuper smooth at 120 hertz with none ofthe battery life hit that usually camewith that smoothness so surely the factthat these new phones can go down evenfurther to just one Hertz is going tostop power consumption in its trackswhen you're just looking at non-movingwebsite Pages not really because forsome reason Apple has restricted the useof the one Hertz refresh rate just tothe always-on display that you now getwhen you turn your phone off and don'tget me wrong that is a great new featurebut it's kind of a shame that they'vebuilt the hardware that we know iscapable of some extreme power savingsbut then not allowed you to fullycapital eyes on that like some otherphones have and now just before we hitthe five hour mark the iPhone SE on thefar right has decided to say it'sgoodbyes this is not what I'd call astrong position to be in and actuallywhile we're at it if you're consideringbuying one of these iPhones my advice isdon't buy the SE if you've got 429dollars to spend on a phone you can geta far better experience with a Googlepixel than nothing firm one 5.99 for theiPhone 12 is better but still nottremendous value either considering thatthat's two year old Tech and that itwasn't exactly bleeding edge even whenit was launched but the iPhone 13 miniand upwards they make sense they're morepowerful they've got better battery lifefor their respective sizes bettercameras they're going to get updates forlonger what I'm saying is that I thinkthe 13 mini is the lowest end iPhoneyou'd need to buy to get a good 2022 iOSexperience okay it is pretty safe to sayat this point that I'm going to losesome sleep tonight look at this Pro Maxit's still in its 40s after over fivehours then has also now separated itselffrom the normal 14 pro which is initself a tier above the base 14. by mynormal battery benchmarks of five hoursbeing just about good enough six beingvery good seven being above and beyondand anything over eight being incredibleit's looking like the 14 pro Max isgoing to be well beyond that and theiPhone 14 plus that we're going toestimate is also looking very strongindeed based on how the 14 is doing solet's fast forward this test and get tothe results to find out if they do thatbear in Mind by the way that on thistest every phone has had Wi-Fi onBluetooth on brightness matched to eachother but on the high side they're allon light mode and the speakers are setto 50 volume so if anything this isprobably slightly more intense than anormal day and if you're conscious aboutyour battery you could make each one ofthese phones last longer than it isdoing right now but then on the flipside this test doesn't account for anybattery that you might lose while yourphone is on standby in between whenyou're using it but thankfully thatdoesn't change much because iPhones tendto lose very little when not in use andthat leads us to the results so ineighth place at Just 4 hours 52 minutesiPhone SE the only time that I wouldrecommend this phone is if you were acompletely sold on having a physicalhome button and never wanted to learnfull screen gestures be willing to havea very small screen and a basic cameraand then see on not a big social mediauser

of a shamebecause it is a photo that Apple sayingwill have incredible battery life butthe good news is that because of howsimilarities to the normal iPhone 14 inevery other spec apart from battery sizewe will actually be able to closelyextrapolate its battery life by the endof the test it's hard to say what I'mexpecting at this point from the iPhone14s because the battery life on my 13Pro Max was absolutely Stellar when Ifirst got it like genuinely so good thatI was sometimes finishing days with 40left and so it doesn't feel like a veryApple thing to do to make it even betterthis company is not in the business oftrying to cater to the niche one percentof users for who battery life was alimiting factor on that phone but thenequally the other thing that I'venoticed on my 13 Pro Max is that oneyear on the battery life has fallenquite significantly it's not quite thethe make it through anything hero thatthe phone once was and so some part ofme is still hoping that the 14 pro Maxcan take battery life another stepfurther to just guarantee that batterycapacity over its entire lifespan so farit's looking possible after an hour anda half the 14 Pros are starting toseparate from the rest of the pack butstill very healthy levels of charge leftit's anyone you have all the phones sathere on the same table at the same timethat you realize how much moreaesthetically pleasing Apple's new holepunch camera is well equally howoutdated the notch on the other phone'slooks the screen borders are alsothinner than ever on the 14 Pros whichis a difference that I've been reallystruggling to notice until I startedrecording this battery test you can seeif you compare the the left hand sidebezel of the 14 pro with the left handside bezel at the 14 a subtle differencebut it is one of my favorite things tosee get upgraded alright two hours nowthe pros are comfortably ahead and thisis where I was expecting them to startto creep further ahead because we canplay some games up until this point allof these phones chipsets have beenfairly idle but these games will pushthem to work hard and this shouldhighlight any efficiency games thatApple's made with it for the last fewgenerations of chips Apple has beenheavily focused not on Pure Performancethey've almost taken it as a given thatthey're already ahead in that but moreon performance per watt of powerconsumed and the result of that shouldbe a set of increasingly streamlinedchips that each draw less power than thelast while performing the same task thatsaid it doesn't seem like a world ofdifference like the iPhone 12 with itstwo generation old A14 bionic chip itdoesn't just suddenly start losingbattery way faster than the 14 Proswhich are running the New a16 Monic it'sa subtle upgrade a lot of this is downto the way it's marketed to us like whena company announces a brand new chip andthey say it has 15 more performance perwatt than last year it kind of makes youthink well I'm gonna get 15 more batterylife on top of all all the other greatperformance improvements they promisedtoo but then you realize not only willthat 15 be a hand selected best keyscenario figure but also it does infactor in that if you're dialing up theperformance at the same time then evenif your performance per watt is going upyou may still end up drawing just asmuch power if not more than lastgeneration but this is the iPhone 14Pro's second chance to completely pullahead of everyone elseinternet browsing because here's thething the new display Tech on the 14Pros lets them scale their refresh rateall the way down from the peak of 120hertz to just one Hertz now if you'relooking at something static and I wasconvinced that this was going to be thenail in the coffin for every other phoneif you remember last year's iPhone 13Pros they had the option to scale theirrefresh rates from 120 hertz all the waydown to 10 Hertz and even that wasawesome for battery life it basicallyallowed you to have a display that feltsuper smooth at 120 hertz with none ofthe battery life hit that usually camewith that smoothness so surely the factthat these new phones can go down evenfurther to just one Hertz is going tostop power consumption in its trackswhen you're just looking at non-movingwebsite Pages not really because forsome reason Apple has restricted the useof the one Hertz refresh rate just tothe always-on display that you now getwhen you turn your phone off and don'tget me wrong that is a great new featurebut it's kind of a shame that they'vebuilt the hardware that we know iscapable of some extreme power savingsbut then not allowed you to fullycapital eyes on that like some otherphones have and now just before we hitthe five hour mark the iPhone SE on thefar right has decided to say it'sgoodbyes this is not what I'd call astrong position to be in and actuallywhile we're at it if you're consideringbuying one of these iPhones my advice isdon't buy the SE if you've got 429dollars to spend on a phone you can geta far better experience with a Googlepixel than nothing firm one 5.99 for theiPhone 12 is better but still nottremendous value either considering thatthat's two year old Tech and that itwasn't exactly bleeding edge even whenit was launched but the iPhone 13 miniand upwards they make sense they're morepowerful they've got better battery lifefor their respective sizes bettercameras they're going to get updates forlonger what I'm saying is that I thinkthe 13 mini is the lowest end iPhoneyou'd need to buy to get a good 2022 iOSexperience okay it is pretty safe to sayat this point that I'm going to losesome sleep tonight look at this Pro Maxit's still in its 40s after over fivehours then has also now separated itselffrom the normal 14 pro which is initself a tier above the base 14. by mynormal battery benchmarks of five hoursbeing just about good enough six beingvery good seven being above and beyondand anything over eight being incredibleit's looking like the 14 pro Max isgoing to be well beyond that and theiPhone 14 plus that we're going toestimate is also looking very strongindeed based on how the 14 is doing solet's fast forward this test and get tothe results to find out if they do thatbear in Mind by the way that on thistest every phone has had Wi-Fi onBluetooth on brightness matched to eachother but on the high side they're allon light mode and the speakers are setto 50 volume so if anything this isprobably slightly more intense than anormal day and if you're conscious aboutyour battery you could make each one ofthese phones last longer than it isdoing right now but then on the flipside this test doesn't account for anybattery that you might lose while yourphone is on standby in between whenyou're using it but thankfully thatdoesn't change much because iPhones tendto lose very little when not in use andthat leads us to the results so ineighth place at Just 4 hours 52 minutesiPhone SE the only time that I wouldrecommend this phone is if you were acompletely sold on having a physicalhome button and never wanted to learnfull screen gestures be willing to havea very small screen and a basic cameraand then see on not a big social mediauser for anyone who spends even a coupleof hours a day on YouTube or Instagramthat will be half your battery gone thenin seventh surviving a landslide longerthan that we have the iPhone 13 mini andthis phone is good I would recommend itbut only if you are specificallysearching for a small phone assumingthat you are then there are very fewthat have managed to achieve thisshrinking with such little compromisebut if you're not then you can get muchbetter battery life going for thefull-size iPhone 30. the 12 is nextthough but close enough to the 13 minithat it's give or take it's roughlyequivalent between them which given thatthis phone also doesn't have the benefitof being tiny like the 30 mini doesn'treally have a place in my books funnilyenough next up was not the iPhone 13 butactually the iPhone 14 Landing in at 7hours and 13 minutes I wouldn't takethat defeat too seriously they don'tneed loss to the iPhone 13 by around 2minutes and the battery life is alreadyin a very comfortable place the reasonyou would get an iPhone 14 over aniPhone 13 is not really extra batterylife it's primarily cameras really ithas better front camera and a better setof rear cameras so then that's 7 hours15 Good Old Reliable iPhone 13. firmlyin the above and beyond category and Iknow tons of people with iPhone 13s andpretty much the top comments that I getfrom these people is that battery lifeis good in it yeah that's what myfriends sound likethis is probably the closest I've everbeen to recommending last year's phoneover this year's photo but yeah I meanyou can take this as reassurance thatthe iPhone 13 is still a good purchasein late 2022. third place though is abig jump iPhone 14 pro with 7 hours and49 minutes even with a similar sizedbody and a similar sized battery thisfan managed to last a full 35 minuteslonger than the base 14. thoroughlyimpressed with this phone and not justthe battery the cameras too my fullcamera test is linked Below in case youwant to see it but now we have the Rogueone at this point I can tell you with afairly High degree of certainty that thenumber two best battery life in a testlike this will actually belong to theiPhone 14 plus given that the iPhone 14lasted 7 hours 13 and that Apple's owntesting has found that the 14 plus hasan extra 30 battery life lead on the 14that would place this phone at around 9hours 23 if we run it through the samesituation to have 30 more battery lifethan the base 14 makes this a verytempting phone in my books but at thesame time it's actually sad because Idon't imagine it's going to sell toowell now that leads us with first theiPhone 14 pro Max at 9 hours and 31.it's not mind-blowing it's actuallyslightly worse performance than the 13Pro Max but nonetheless this is still onthe top shelf of what currentsmartphones have to offer anotherinteresting note regarding apple is thatit seems like as well as phones they'realso slowly but surely becoming an adbusiness over the last few years they'vestarted cracking down on how othercompanies like meta are allowed toadvertise to iPhone users then it turnsout that's because Apple wants toadvertise to iPhone users within theirown Apple apps

            "Apple hasn\u2019t made any bones about the fact that there are certain products it has that aren\u2019t meant for everyone. Some of these \u2014 like the Mac Studio or even the Mac mini \u2014 are way too niche and will be sought by those who really need them. And then there are those that bring the best of Apple at an expensive \u2014 very expensive \u2014 price point but are desired by many. The iPhone\u2019s Pro models have always been in the category \u2014 the coveted one, the desirable one, the one that makes you want to junk that financial prudence that has been drilled in you. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is very much that phone \u2014 the best of Apple and by now you know that it is an expensive phone. Rs 1,39,900 is the starting price and there\u2019s little point in debating on why it\u2019s so expensive and whether it\u2019s value for money or not. It\u2019s an Apple product, it is an iPhone, and it is the Pro Max variant \u2014 of course it will be expensive. Apple wants your money and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that dangling proposition that may just want you to break the bank and get one.DESIGN AND DISPLAYSeen one? Seen all. If you have seen the iPhone 12 Pro Max or the iPhone 13 Pro Max then the iPhone 14 Pro Max has very little different to offer in terms of design. It\u2019s a popular design with a stainless frame that looks elegant and the frosted glass back is still gorgeous to look at. Apple knows that this design is a hit and there\u2019s no point in expecting it to change anytime soon. Generally, an Apple design lasts for years before a new one comes. Don\u2019t believe us? Look at the MacBook Air, which followed a similar design philosophy for years till the M2 model arrived this year. So don\u2019t expect Apple to make wholesale changes to the design every year, you will only get disappointed.The one remarkable thing about the design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that yes, you have seen it before and yes, it hasn\u2019t changed but it still looks great. But do keep in mind that this is a really big phone. If you aren\u2019t used to a big phone then perhaps think twice before getting this or look at the iPhone 14 Pro instead. I wouldn\u2019t call it unwieldy but yes, it is certainly not a one-handed phone. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra felt really big but this one feels rather bigger in the hand. And yes, it is heavy as well at 240 grams.The big size is preferred by many as it brings in a big display and it\u2019s a compromise many would settle for on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixel and 460ppi pixel density. What\u2019s that in common parlance? An excellent display that is great to look at, colour reproduction is accurate and the brightness levels are optimum. Apple claims that the iPhone 14 Pro Max offers the maximum brightness in a smartphone \u2014 2000 nits of brightness in direct sunlight. We had zero problems reading on the iPhone 14 Pro Max even when it was really sunny outside.The 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate works as smoothly as it did on the iPhone 13 Pro Max \u2014 no complaints or no changes here to see. The display is extremely snappy and a lot of it is down to iOS 16 as well as Apple does handle animations much better than most of its competition does.If the refresh rate and other specs remain the same, then there\u2019s something new in the form of the Always-on display. Better late than never, some may say. Apple is fashionably late but has arrived in some style. Now I am sure you must have read that some Android phone brought Always-on display first. Heck, even Google couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to take a dig at Apple during its biggest hardware event of 2022. But Apple has created a perception that it isn\u2019t in the rat race and that some features might not come first but they do come with a difference. Like the Always-on display.Apple\u2019s implementation of Always-on display is unlike any other smartphone. What happens on the iPhone 14 Pro Max when Always-on display is turned on is that the lock screen is dimmed. \u201cDisplay, display on the phone, who\u2019s the prettiest of \u2018em all?\u201d It\u2019s the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the Always-on display. You can see notifications, lock screen widgets and everything else but it is subtly dimmed. If you have an iPhone and you use it for the first time, you might feel that was there a need for this? Not really but once you\u2019ve used it, I bet you will not be able to use the iPhone 14 Pro Max without toggling on the Always-on display.DYNAMIC ISLANDNow generally we tend to keep all display features in one sub-head but we are making an exception for the Dynamic Island. After all it is the belle of the ball, the headline act of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Or at least it\u2019s the most-talked about feature on this year\u2019s iPhones. And it does deserve a separate section as it is delightfully done. The notch was Apple\u2019s gift to the smartphone industry. The first year after the launch of iPhone X \u2014 the first one with the notch \u2014 Android brands made a beeline to adopt the notch as if Santa Claus handed it out on Christmas. But then Android phone makers came up with their really good iterations of it and Apple stuck with the notch until the Dynamic Island arrived with the iPhone 14 Pro models. And man, it is so well done that you just keep fiddling with it only for the first few days \u2014 at least that\u2019s what I found myself doing. The Dynamic Island is a different take on the notch and makes the use of that space which no one else ever thought of doing it before Apple. Not a fan of the name but this is a really cool feature to use and is not gimmicky at all.For someone who uses Apple Music a lot more than one should, the Dynamic Island is a treat. It will show the album artwork along the playback controls, and the waveform, AirPlay \u2014 all in that tiny little space. If you are using any app and get an incoming call, then the Dynamic Island will show the alert and all the call controls. AirPods Pro\u2019s battery life also appears in the Dynamic Island. Apple Maps directions also come on the Dynamic Island and so much so that at times I did ditch Google Maps for it because it looks really good.Apple has always had a way of showing all these notifications but never had a \u2018home\u2019 \u2014 which is now the Dynamic Island. In a few months, here\u2019s hoping that other developers take advantage of the Dynamic Island as it is a really fun and useful feature. Apple is expected to launch Live Activities API soon and that\u2019s when we will really see the Dynamic Island thrive and it is something that should get a lot of people excited. Is the feature good enough to pay the difference between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro price? It certainly is if you want the complete iPhone experience.CAMERAIt has been well established that the iPhone cameras are one of the most consistent and versatile ones around. Apple seemed mightily reluctant to get in the megapixel race and remained steady with 12MP cameras. A case of better late than never yet again and once more Apple has done it differently. The primary camera now has a 48MP sensor, which produces some excellent images. All the images clicked from the 48MP camera have rich colours and look exceptionally vibrant and true to life. There are a lot of details captured especially in the images which were clicked using ProRAW. Like every other 48MP camera, Apple too uses pixel binning to give you 12MP images only but the ProRAW mode actually gives you 48MP images. And the difference is quite stark as more details are captured. But the trade-off is that images clicked with the 48MP camera consume a lot of space, like a lot. The photos we clicked ranged anywhere between 12MB to 42MB \u2014 so use it rather judiciously. Of course, ProRAW is meant not just for utilising the 48MP camera.What works in the favour of the primary 48MP camera \u2014 with and without pixel binning \u2014 is the consistency it offers. You can be clicking in good lighting condition or not-so-good conditions, the iPhone 14 Pro Max delivers images that make you sit up and take note. Apple has certainly improved low-light photography as the iPhone 14 Pro Max does a wonderful job when the lights are dimmed. What the 48MP primary camera also gives is the option of 2x optical zoom lens \u2014 a nice addition to the iPhone 14 Pro Max\u2019s camera\u2019s arsenal.The other 12MP cameras \u2014 telephoto and ultra-wide \u2014 also do a fine job of clicking images. Portraits clicked on the iPhone 14 Pro Max look great and bokeh effect is spot on. Apple\u2019s computational photography has been a step ahead of others and on the iPhone 14 Pro Max you get the Photonic Engine. As per Apple, this is meant to improve colour reproduction and click better images in less light.The lack of zoom on the telephoto camera now does rankle a bit. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers 3x zoom at a time when the likes of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra can go up to 100x. I do wish Apple brings more zoom capabilities on the next iPhone as it is perhaps the only feature that is missing on these cameras.The Macro mode \u2014 enabled automatically \u2014 is a true delight on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. No one has done a better job with the macro mode than Apple as the results are truly excellent. Try capturing fabrics with the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the level of details is fascinating to see. You will find macro modes in so many smartphones\u2019 cameras but the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a cut above the rest.For the selfie/usfie/groupfie/whateverfie brigade, Apple has added a brand new camera. The 12MP camera now gets autofocus and it is really impressive. And it really shows in FaceTime calls or other video calls as well. There\u2019s more clarity than there ever was on any iPhone. The front camera is a significant improvement on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Where the iPhone 14 Pro Max\u2019s camera really shines is videos. Apple brought Cinematic Mode last year with the iPhone 13 Pros and with the iPhone 14 Pros, you get the all-new Action Mode. No, it\u2019s not a gimbal or anything like that. What it does is it really it offers really good stabilisation and that\u2019s because Apple has improved EIS (electronic image stabilisation). You don\u2019t get 4K recording with this mode as maximum resolution offered is 2.8K but it is still very good. The footage almost always remained really stable. The Cinematic Mode still remains great fun to use.Is this the best camera setup in any smartphone? Not exactly but it is certainly most versatile and consistent cameras in any smartphone. Almost every image is pleasing to look at and more than anything, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes you want to click more images \u2014 something that I can\u2019t say about any other smartphone, except the Pixel phones.PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFEThis will be rather short and concise: the A-series Bionic processors on the iPhones have always been blazing fast and the iPhone 14 Pro Max with A16 is no different. The phone is a total powerhouse in every sense and handles all sorts of tasks comically well. You really can\u2019t find any fault in the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as it really is flawless. The iOS 16 experience is still getting refined so you might see a bug here and there but I expect Apple to sort that out soon.The iPhone 13 Pro Max by far had the best battery performance I have seen in all the phones reviewed in the last 12 months. Expectations were lofty from the iPhone 14 Pro Max and it was a rather bumpy start. In the first few days, with just under 5 hours of screen time, the phone had consumed close to 84% battery \u2014 alarm bells did ring as Apple did tout the battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However after a few days normalcy was resumed as with six hours of screen time \u2014 with Always-on enabled \u2014 the iPhone 14 Pro Max still had 40% battery left. Does the Always-on display consume a lot of battery?Slightly but it\u2019s not a battery guzzling feature. Overall, with a lot of streaming on Apple Music, Safari, WhatsApp, social media activities on a daily basis, the iPhone 14 Pro Max can really go on for a day \u2014 and then some \u2014 on a single charge.VERDICTApple has made a habit of making excellent smartphones and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is no different. There\u2019s no escaping the fact that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy \u2014 starting at Rs 1,39,900 and goes up to Rs 1,89,900 (1TB storage variant). You might think that it will be a hard sell especially in a country like India. India still remains a vanilla iPhone island but the aspiration to go Pro is strong as ever.This year Apple has really separated the Pro models from the vanilla ones with the iPhone 14 series. And there is still an audience that salivates at the thought of getting an iPhone Pro \u2014 perhaps they have used the vanilla and want an upgrade or they are the ones that just want the best of Apple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max gets the best of Apple in every sense. The display is a delight \u2014 Dynamic Island is great fun \u2014 and the cameras have been upgraded as well. Should you go for it? Without battling an eyelid as long as you can splash the cash The iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the best smartphones money can buy.",
