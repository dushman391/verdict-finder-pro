hi unfortunately we had to cancel thethe talk that we had planned for GDC butwe do have some super exciting newsabout ps5 and who better to bring thatto you than the one and only mark Cernywithout further ado over to you markthank you Jim there will be lots ofchances later on this year to look atthe PlayStation 5 games today I want totalk a bit about our goals for thePlayStation 5 hardware and how theyinfluenced the development of theconsole I think you all know I'm a bigbeliever in console generations onceevery 5 or 6 or 7 years a consolearrives with substantially newcapabilities there's a lot of learningby the game developers hopefully not toooverwhelming and soon there's games thatcould never have been created before nowit used to be that as a console designeryou'd somehow Intuit what would be thebest set of capabilities for the newconsole and then build it in completesecrecy for the PlayStation consolesthat period lasted through PlayStation 3a powerful and groundbreaking consolebut also one that caused quite a lot ofheartache as it was initially difficultto develop games for so starting withPlayStation 4 we've taken a differentapproach roughly centered around threeprinciples the first of these islistening to the developers which is tosay that a lot of what we put into aconsole derives directly from the needsand aspirations of the game creators wedefinitely do have some ideas of our ownbut at the core of our philosophy fordesigning consoles is that game playersare here for the fantastic games whichis to say that game creators matteranything we can do to make life easierfor the game creators or help themrealize their dreams we will do so aboutonce every two years I take a tour ofthe industry I go to the variousdevelopers and publishers sit down anddiscuss how they're doing with thecurrent consoles and what they'd like tosee in future consoles this requiresweeks on the road as reaching the bulkof the game creators involves talking towell over a hundred people it'ssomething like two dozen publishers anddevelopers and it is incredibly valuableby the way the feature most requested bythe developers that was an SST which wewere very happy to put in hardware but alot of problem solving was required I'llbe doing a deep dive on the SSD andsurrounding systems later on in thistalk it's also key to make agenerational leaf while keeping theconsole sufficiently familiar to gamedevelopers I think about this in termsof balancing evolution and revolutionnow with Playstation one two and threethe target was a revolution each timewith a brand new feature set that wasgreat in many ways but time for thedevelopers to get up and running gotlonger with each console in the pastI've called this time to triangle here'swhat I had for those three consoles tobe clear I'm not talking about time tomake a game developers will be ambitiousand it may take them six years or so torealize their vision what I'm talkingabout is that dead time before graphicsand other aspects of game developmentare up and running and trying tominimize that on the other hand if we'retrying to reduce that dead time to 0that means the hardware architecturecan't change at allwe're handcuffed we need to judge foreach feature what value it adds andwhether it's worth the increase indeveloper time needed to support it sowith Playstation 4 we were able tostrike a pretty good balance betweenperformance and familiarity we gotrequired learning back to PlayStation 1levels with PS 5 the GPU was definitelythe area that we felt the most tensionbetween adding new features and keepinga familiar programming model ultimatelyI think we've ended up with somethingunder a month of getting up to speedthat feels like we're striking about theright balance I'll go into a bit moredetail later today about our philosophywith the GPU and the specific featureset that resulted from it it's also veryimportant for us as the hardware team tofind new dreams by which I meansomething other than CPU performance GPUperformance and the amount of RAM theincrease in graphics performance overthe past two decades has beenastonishing but there are other areas inwhich we can innovate and provide asignificant value to the game creatorsand through themthe players that's why the SSD was verymuch on our list of directions toexplore regardless of what came out ofthe conversations with game developersand publishers the biggest feature inthis category is the custom engine foraudio that's today's final topic thepush for vastly improved audio and inparticular 3d audio isn't something thatcame out of the developer meetings it'smuch more the case that we had a dreamof what might be possible five yearsfrom now and then worked out a number ofsteps we could take to set us on thatpath so here again are the threeprinciples the first being enabling thedesires of developers to drive thehardware design to me the SSD really isthe key to the next generation it's agame changer and it was the number oneask from developers for PlayStation 5 asin we know it's probably impossible butcan you put an SSD in it that was adiscussion we were also havinginternally it was clear that thepresence of a hard drive in everyPlayStation 4 was having a positiveimpact a lot of things that would simplyhave been impossible at blu-ray discspeeds were now possible at the sametime though in 2015 and 2016 when wewere having these conversationsdevelopers were already banging upagainst the limits of the hard drive anda lot of developer time was being spentdesigning around slow load speeds I wantto focus in on just one number herewhich is how long it takes to load agigabyte of data from a hard drive thedifficulty being that hard drives areneither particularly fast nor flexibleif all your data is in one block whichis frankly not very likely you can load50 to 100 megabytes a second dependingon where the data is located on the harddrive let's assume it's on the outeredge which means loading a gigabytetakes 10 seconds if you compress yourgame packages you can fit more data onthe blu-ray disc and also effectivelyboost your hard drive read speed by thecompression ratio we support Z Libdecompression on PlayStation 4 that getsyou something like 50% more data on thedisk and 50% higher effective read speedunfortunately though it's highly likelythat your data is scattered around infiles on the hard drive as well assourced from multiple locations withinthose files so lots of Sikhs are neededat two to fifty ish milliseconds each myrule of thumb is that the hard drive isspending two-thirds of its time seekingand only a third of its time actuallyloading data putting all of thattogether a gigabyte is very roughly 20seconds to load from a hard drive now agigabyte is not much data games areusing five or six gigabytes of RAM onPlayStation 4 so boot times and loadtons can get pretty grim or to put thatdifferently as a player you wait for thegame to boot wait for the game to loadwait for the level to reload every timeyou die and you wait for what iseuphemistically calledfast travel and all of that leads to thedream what if we could have not just anSSD but a blindingly fast Assisting ifwe could load five gigabytes a secondfrom it what would change now SSDs arecompletely different from hard drivesthey don't have sikhsas such if you have a five gigabyte asecond SSD you can read data from athousand different locations in thatsecond pretty much at speed as for timeto load a gigabyte this is next-genwe're talking about so memory is biggerinstead we should be asking how long toload two gigabytes and the answer isabout a quarter of a second that'samazing we're talking two orders ofmagnitude meaning very roughly 100 timesfaster which means at five gigabytes asecond for the SSD the potential is thatthe game boots in a second there are noload screens the game just fades downwhile loading a half dozen gigabytes andfades back up again same for a reloadyou're immediately back in the actionafter you die and fast travel becomes sofast it's blinking you miss it as gamecreators we go from trying to distractthe player from how long fast travel istaking like those spider-man subwayrides to being so blindingly fast thatwe might even have to slow thattransition down pretty cool right butfor me this is not the primary reason tochange from a hard drive to an SSD theprimary reason for an ultraSST is that it gives the game designerfreedom or to put that differently witha hard drive the twenty seconds that ittakes to load a gigabyte can sabotagethe game that the developer is trying tocreate I think almost all of us in theroom have experienced this maybe indifferent ways say we're making anadventure game and we have two richenvironments where we each want enoughtextures and models to fill memory whatyou can do as long as you have a longstaircase or elevator ride or a windycorridor where you can ditch the oldassets and then take 30 seconds or so toload the new assets having a 30 secondelevator ride is a little extrememore realistically we'd probably chopthe world into a number of smallerpieces and then do some calculationswith sightlines and run speeds like wedid for Haven city when we were makingjak 2 the game is 20 years old but notmuch has changed since then all thosetwisty passages are there for a reasonthere's a whole subset of level designdedicated to this sort of work but stillit's a giant distraction for a team thatjust wants to make their game so when Italked about the dream of an SSD part ofthe reason for that 5 gigabyte a secondtarget was to eliminate loads but alsopart of the reason for that target wasstreaming as in what if the SSD is sofast that as the player is turningaround it's possible to load texturesfor everything behind the player in thatsplit second if you figure that it takeshalf a second to turn that's fourgigabytes of compressed data you canload that sounds about right for nextgen anyway back to the hard driveanother strategy for increasingeffective read speed is to make bigsequential chunks of data for example wemight group all the data together foreach city block that removes most of theseeks and the streaming gets faster butthere's a downside too which is thatfrequently used data is included in manychunks and therefore is on the harddrive many many timesMarvel spider-men uses this strategy andthough it works very well for increasingthe streaming speed there's a massiveduplication as a result some of theobjects like mailboxes or newsracks areon the hard drive forhundred times what I'm describing hereare things that crampa creative director style either leveldesign gets a little bit boring inplaces or the data is duplicated so manytimes that it no longer fits on theblu-ray disk and you end up with hardlimits on the players run speed ordriving speed the player can't go fasterthan the load speed from the hard driveand finally I'm sure many of you havenoticed that after a patch download thePlayStation 4 will sometimes take a longtime to install the patch that's becausewhen just part of a file has beenchanged the new data can be downloadedpretty quickly but before the game bootsup a brand new file has to beconstructed that includes the changedportion otherwise every change would adda seek or two even so you canoccasionally see this happening on gametitles they start to hitch once they getpatched enough with an SSD though noseeks so no need to make brand new fileswith the changes incorporated into themwhich means no installs as you know themtoday there's yet one more benefit whichis that system memory can be used muchmore efficiently on PlayStation 4 gamedata on the hard drive feels verydistant and difficult to use by the timeyou realize you need a piece of datait's much too late to go out and load itso system memory has to contain all ofthe data that could be used in the next30 seconds or so of gameplay that meansa lot of the eight gigabytes of systemmemory is idle it's just waiting thereto be potentially used on PlayStation 5though the SSD is very close to beinglike more RAM typically it's fast enoughthat when you realize you need a pieceof data you can just load it from theSSD and use it there's no need to havelots of data parked in system memorywaiting to potentially be used adifferent way of saying that is thatmost of Ram is working on the game'sbehalf this is one of the reasons that16 gigabytes of gddr5 for playstation 5the presence of the SSD reduces the needfor a massive intergenerational increasein size so back to the dream of the SSDhere's the set of targetsbuuut the game in a second no loadscreens design freedom meaning no twistypassages or long corridors more game onthe disk and more game on the SSD andfinally those patch installs go away thereality though is that the SSD is justone piece of the puzzle there's a lot ofplaces where bottlenecks can occur inbetween the SSD and the game code thatuses the data you can see this onPlayStation 4 if I use an SSD with 10times the speed of a standard hard driveI probably see only double the loadingspeed if that for PlayStation 5 our goalwas not just that the SSD itself be ahundred times faster it was that gameloads and streaming would be a hundredtimes faster so every single potentialbottleneck needed to be addressed andthere are a lot of them let's look atcheck-in and what happens when itsoverhead gets a hundred times largerconceptually check-in is a pretty simpleprocess data is loaded into systemmemory from the hard drive or SSD it'sexamined a few values are tweaked tocheck it in and then it's moved to itsfinal location at the SSD speeds we'retalking about that last part moving thedata meaning copying it from onelocation to another takes roughly anentire next-gen CPU core and that's justthe tip of the iceberg if all theoverheads get a hundred times largerthat will the framerate as soonas the player moves and that massivestream of data starts coming off the SSDso to solve all of that we built a lotof custom hardware namely a custom flashcontroller and a number of custom unitsin our main chip the flash controller inthe SSD was designed for smooth andbottleneck free operation but also withgames in mind for example there are sixlevels of priority when reading from theSSD priority is very important you canimagine the player heading into some newlocation in the world and the gamerequesting a few gigabytes of texturesand while those textures are beingloaded an enemy is shot and has to speaka few dying words having multiplepriority levels let's the audio forthose dying words get loaded immediatelyon one side that flash controllerconnects to the actual- dyes that supply of the storage toreach art bandwidth target of 5gigabytes a second we ended up with a 12channel interface 8 channels wouldn't beenough the resulting bandwidth we haveachieved is actually five and a halfgigabytes a second with a 12 channelinterface the most natural size thatemerges for an SSD is 825 gigabytes thekey question for us was is that enoughit's tempting to add more but flashcertainly doesn't come cheap and we havea responsibility to our gaming audienceto be cost effective with regards towhat we put in the console ultimately weresolve this question by looking at theplay patterns of a broad range of gamerswe examined the specific games that theywere playing over the course of aweekend or week or a month and whetherthat set of games would fit properly onthe SSD we were able to establish thatthe friction caused by reinstalled orread downloads would be quite low and sowe locked in on that825 gigabyte size while also preparingmultiple strategies so that those whowant more storage can add it I'll gothrough the details in a momentback to the flash controller on theother side it connects to our maincustom chip via four lanes of Gen 4 PCIeand inside the main custom chip is apretty hefty unit dedicated to i/obefore we talk about what that doeslet's talk compression for a momentPlayStation 4 used Z live as itscompression format we decided to use itagain on PlayStation 5 but on my 2017tour of developers I learned about a newformat called Kraken from rad game toolsit's like Z libs smarter cousin simplesimilar types of algorithms but about10% better compression which is prettybig that means 10% more game on the UHDblu-ray disc or on the SSD kraken hadonly been out for a year that it wasalready becoming a de-facto industrystandard half of the teams I talked toor either using it or getting ready toevaluate it so we hustled and built acustom decompressor into the i/o unitone capable of handling over 5 gigabytesof crack andformat input data a second afterdecompression that typically becomeseight or nine gigabytes but the unititself is capable of outputting as muchas 22 gigabytes a second if the datahappened to compress particularly wellby the way in terms of performance thatcustom decompressor equates to nine ofour Xen two coresthat's what it would take to decompressthe kraken stream with a conventionalCPU there's a lot more in the custom IOunit including a dedicated DMAcontroller the game can direct exactlywhere it wants to send the data comingoff of the SSD this equates to anotherXen two core or two in terms of its copyperformance its primary purpose is toremove check in as a bottleneck there'stwo dedicated i/o coprocessors in alarge ramp poolthese are tins in 2 cores there arethere principally to direct the varietyof custom hardware around them one ofthe co processors is dedicated to SSDi/o this lets us bypass traditional filei/o and it's bottlenecks when readingfrom the SSD the other is responsiblefor memory mapping which I know doesn'tsound like anything related to the SSDbut a lot of developers map and remapmemory as part of file i/o and this toocan become a bottleneck there arecoherency engines to assist thecoprocessors coherency comes up a lot inplaces probably the biggest coherencyissue is stale data in the GPU cachesflushing all of the GPU caches wheneverthe SSD is read is an unattractiveoption it could really hurt the GPUperformance so we've implemented agentler way of doing things where thecoherency engines inform the GPU of theoverwritten address ranges and customscrubbers in several dozen GPU caches dopinpoint evictions of just those addressranges the best thing is as a gamedeveloper when you read from the SSD youdon't need to know any of this you don'teven need to know that your data iscompressed you just indicate what datayou'd like to read from your originaluncompressed file and where you'd liketo put it and the whole process ofloading it happens invisibly to you andat very high speed back to the dreamthanks to all of that surrounding hardour 5.5 gigabytes a second really shouldtranslate into something like a hundredtimes faster IO than ps4 and allow thedream of no load screens and superfaststreaming to become a realityhaving said that expandability of ourSSD is going to be quite importantflash is costly and you may very wellwant to add storage to whatever we putin the console now the kind of storageyou need depends on how you're going touse it if you have an extensivePlayStation 4 library and you'd like totake advantage of backwardscompatibility to play those games onPlayStation 5 then a large external harddrive is ideal you can leave your gameson the hard drive and play them directlyfrom there thus saving the pricier SSDstorage for your PlayStation 5 titles oryou can copy your active PlayStation 4titles to the SSD if your purpose inadding more storage is to playplaystation 5 titles though ideally youwould add to your SSD storage we will besupporting certain m2 SSDs these areinternal drives that you can get on theopen market and install in a bay in theplaystation 5 as for which ones wesupport and when I'll get to that in amoment they connect through the customio unit just like our SSD does so theycan take full advantage of thedecompression io coprocessors and allthe other features I was talking abouthere's the catch though that commercialdrive has to be at least as fast as oursgames that rely on the speed of our SSDneed to work flawlessly with nem todrive when I gave the Wired interviewlast year I said that the PlayStation 5SSD was faster than anything availableon PC at the time commercial M 2 drivesused pcie 3.0 and four lanes of that capout at 3.5 gigabytes a second in otherwords no pcie 3.0 Drive can hit therequired spec M 2 drives with PCI u 4.0or now out in the market we're gettingour in samples and seeing four or fivegigabytes a second from them by year'send I expect there will be drives thatsaturate 4.0 and support seven gigabytesa second having said that we arecomparingapples and oranges though because thatcommercial m2 Drive will have its ownarchitecture its own flash controllerand so on for example the nvmespecification lays out a priority schemefor requests that the m2 drives can useand that scheme is pretty nice but itonly has two true priority levels ourdrive supports six we can hook up adrive with only two priority levelsdefinitely but our custom IO unit has toarbitrate the extra priorities ratherthan the m2 drives flash controller andso the m2 drive needs a little extraspeed to take care of issues arisingfrom the different approach thatCommercial Drive also needs tophysically fit inside of the bay wecreated in PlayStation 5 for m2 drivesunlike internal hard drives there'sunfortunately no standard for the heightof an m2 Drive and some m2 drives havegiant heat sinks in fact some of themeven have their own fans right now we'regetting em to drive samples andbenchmarking them in various ways whengames hit in beta as they get ready forthe PlayStation 5 launch at year-endwe'll also be doing some compatibilitytesting to make sure that thearchitecture of particular M 2 drivesisn't too foreign for the games tohandle once we've done thatcompatibility testing we should be ableto start letting you know which driveswill physically fit and which drivesamples have benchmark appropriatelyhigh in our testing it would be great ifthat happened by launch but it's likelyto be a bit past it so please hold offon getting that M to drive until youhear from us ok back to our principlesbalancing evolution and revolution isthe second of them this was definitely arecurring theme with the GPU we need newGPU features and capabilities if if weonly have more performance it's notreally a new generation of console ofcourse many of these capabilities resultin more performance that's part of why aPlaystation 5 teraflop is more powerfulthan a Playstation 4 teraflop but wearen't just looking for the performancewe also need the ability to do somethingwith the GPU that could not have beendone before and we need higherperformance per wattevery time we double the performance ofsome GPU component we don't want to findwe've doubled the power consumed and theheat produced but at the same time wehave to make sure the GPU can run ps4games and we have to ensure that thearchitecture is easy for the developersto adopt now backwards compatibility washandled masterfully by AMD they treatedit as a key need throughout the designprocess as our solution to adding newfeatures without blindsiding developerswe made sure that if there were newsignificant features it would beoptional to use them the GPU supportsray tracing but you don't have to useray tracing to make your game the GPUsupports primitive shaders but you canrelease your first game on PlayStation 5without making any use of them before Iget into the capabilities of the GPU I'dlike to make clear two points that canbe quite confusing first we have acustom AMD GPU based on there are DNA 2technology what does that mean AMD iscontinuously improving and revisingtheir tech for our DNA to their goalswere roughly speaking to reduce power ofconsumption by rhe architecting the GPUto put data close to where it's neededto optimize the GPU for performance andto adding new more advanced feature setbut that feature set is malleable whichis to say that we have our own needs forPlayStation and that can factor intowhat the AMD roadmap becomes socollaboration is born if we bringconcepts to AMD that are felt to bewidely useful then they can be adoptedinto our DNA - and used broadlyincluding in PC GPUs if the ideas aresufficiently specific to what we'retrying to accomplishlike the GPU cache scrubbers I wastalking about then they end up beingjust for us if you see a similardiscrete GPU available as a PC card atroughly the same time as we release ourconsole that means our collaborationwith AMD succeeded in producingtechnology useful in both worlds itdoesn't mean that we as sony simplyincorporated the pc part into ourconsole this continuous improvement inAMD technology means it's dangerous torely on teraflops as an absoluteindicator of performance andsee you count should be avoided as wellin the case of CPUs we all understandthis the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5each have eight CPUs but we never thinkthat meant the capabilities andperformance are equal it's the same forsee use for one thing they've beengetting much larger over timeadding new features means adding lots oftransistors in fact the transistor countfor a Playstation 5 CU is 62% largerthan the transistor count for aplaystation 4 CU second the playstation5 and GPU is backwards compatible withplaystation 4 what does that mean oneway you can achieve backwardscompatibility is to put the previousconsoles chipset in the new console likewe did with some PlayStation 3s butthat's of course extremely expensive abetter way is to incorporate anydifferences in the previous consoleslogic into the new consoles custom chipsmeaning that even as the technologyevolves the logic and feature set thatPlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Protitles rely on is still available inbackwards compatibility modes oneadvantage of this strategy is that oncebackwards compatibility is in theconsole it's in if not as if a cost downwill remove backwards compatibility likeit did on PlayStation 3 achieving thisunification of functionality took yearsof efforts by AMD as any roadmapadvancement creates a potentialdivergence in logic running ps4 and PS 4titles at boosted frequencies has alsoadded complexity the boost is trulymassive this time around and some gamecode just can't handle it testing has tobe done on the title by title basisresults are excellent though we recentlytook a look at the top hundredPlayStation 4 titles as ranked by playtime and we're expecting almost all ofthem to be playable at launch onplaystation 5 with regards to newfeatures as I said our strategy was totry to break new ground but at the sametime not to require use of the new GPUcapabilities for more than a decade GPUshave imposed a restriction on gameengines software handles vertexprocessing but for the most partdedicated hardwareresponsible for the triangles and othergeometry that the vertices form thatmeans it's not possible to do even basicoptimizations such as abortingprocessing of a vertex if all geometrythat uses it is off screen PlayStation 5has a new unit called the geometryengine which brings handling oftriangles and other primitives underfull programmatic control as a gamedeveloper you're free to ignore itsexistence and use the PlayStation 5 GPUas if it were no more capable than theps4 GPU or you can use this newintelligence in various ways simpleusage could be performance optimizationssuch as removing back faced oroff-screen vertices and triangles morecomplex usage involves something calledprimitive shaders which allow the gameto synthesize geometry on-the-fly asit's being rendered it's a brand newcapability using primitive shaders onPlayStation 5 will allow for a broadvariety of techniques including smoothlyvarying level of detail addition ofprocedural detail to close up objectsand improvements to particle effects andother visual special effects anothermajor new feature of our custom our DNA2 based GPU is ray tracing using thesame strategy as AMD's upcoming PC GPUsthe ciues contain a new specialized unitcalled the intersection engine which cancalculate the intersection of rays withboxes and triangles to use theintersection engine first you build whatis called an acceleration structure itsdata in RAM that contains all of yourgeometry there's a specific set offormats you can use their variations onthe same BVH concept then in your shaderprogram you use a new instruction thatasks the intersection engine to checkarray against the BVH while theintersection engine is processing therequested ray triangle or ray boxintersections the shaders are free to doother work having said that the raytracing instruction is pretty memoryintensive so it's a good mix with logicheavy code there's of course no need touse ray tracing ps4 graphics engineswill run just fine on PlayStation 5 butit presents an opportunity for thoseinterested I'm thinking it'lltake less than a million raise a secondto have a big impact on audio thatshould be enough for audio occlusion andsome reverb calculations with a bit moreof the GPU invested in ray-tracing itshould be possible to do some very niceglobal illuminationhaving said that adding ray-tracedshadows and reflections to a traditionalgraphics engine could easily takehundreds of millions of rays a secondand full ray tracing could take billionshow far can we go I'm starting to getquite bullish I've already seen aPlayStation 5 title that's successfullyusing ray tracing based reflections incomplex animated scenes with only modestcosts another set of issues for the GPUinvolved size and frequency how big dowe make the GPU and what frequency do werun it at this is a balancing act thechip has a cost and there's a cost forwhatever we use to supply that chip withpower and to cool it in general I likerunning the GPU at a higher frequencylet me show you why here's two possibleconfigurations for a GPU roughly of thelevel of the PlayStation 4 Pro this is athought experiment don't take theseconfigurations too seriously if you justcalculate teraflops you get the samenumber but actually the performance isnoticeably different because teraflopsis defined as the computationalcapability of the vector ALU that's justone part of the GPU there are a lot ofother units and those other units allrun faster when the GPU frequency ishigher at 33% higher frequencyrasterization goes 33% faster processingthe command buffer goes that much fasterthe l2 and other caches have that muchhigher bandwidth and so onabout the only downside is that systemmemory is 33% further away in terms ofcycles but the large number of benefitsmore than counterbalanced that as afriend of mine says a rising tide liftsall boats also it's easier to fully use36c use in parallel than it is to fullyuse 48c use when triangles are smallit's much harder to fill although seause with useful work so there's a lot tobe said for faster assuming you canhandle the resultingpower and heat issues which frankly wehaven't always done the best Javapart of the reason for that ishistorically our process for setting CPUand GPU frequencies has relied on someheavy duty guesswork with regards to howmuch electrical power games will consumeand how much heat will be produced as aresult inside of the console powerconsumption varies a lot from game togame when I play god of war on my ps4Pro I know the power consumption is highjust by the fan noise but power isn'tsimply about engine quality it's aboutthe minutiae of what's being displayedand how it's counterintuitive butprocessing dense geometry typicallyconsumes less power than processingsimple geometry which is I suspect whyhorizons map screen with its lowtriangle count makes my ps4 pro heat upso much our process on previous consoleshas been to try to guess what themaximum power consumption during theentire console lifetime might be whichis to say the worst case scene in theworst case game and prepare a coolingsolution that we think will be quiet atthat power level if we get it right fannoise is minimal if we get it wrong theconsole will be quite loud for thehigher power games and there's even achance that it might overheat and shutdown if we miss estimate power too badlyPlayStation 5 is especially challengingbecause the CPU supports 256 bit nativeinstructions that consume a lot of powerthese are great here and there butpresumably only minimally used or arethey if we plan for major 256 bitinstruction usage we need to set the CPUclock substantially lower or noticeablyincrease the size of the power supplyand fan so after much discussion wedecided to go with a very differentdirection on PlayStation 5 we built aGPU with 36c use mind you our DNA to seeuse our large each has 62% moretransistors than the CIE use we wereusing on PlayStation 4 so if we comparetransistor counts 36 our DNA to see useequates to roughly 58 PlayStation 4 Cuse it is a fairlysizeable GPU then we went with avariable frequency strategy forPlayStation 5 which is to say wecontinuously run the GPU and CPU inboost mode we supply a generous amountof electrical power and then increasethe frequency of GPU and CPU until theyreach the capabilities of the system'scooling solution it's a completelydifferent paradigm rather than runningat constant frequency and letting powervary based on the workload we run atessentially constant power and let thefrequency band vary based on theworkload we then tackled the engineeringchallenge of a cost-effective andhigh-performance cooling solutiondesigned for that specific power levelin some ways it becomes a simplerproblem because there are no moreunknowns there's no need to guess whatpower consumption the worst case gamemight have as for the details of thecooling solution we're saving them forour teardown I think you'll be quitehappy with what the engineering teamcame up with so how fast can we run theGPU and CPU with this strategy thesimplest approach would be to look atthe actual temperature of the silicondie and throttle the frequency on thatbasis but that won't work it fails tocreate a consistent PlayStation 5experience it wouldn't do to run aconsole slower simply because it was ina hot room so rather than look at theactual temperature of the silicon die welook at the activities that the GPU andCPU are performing and set thefrequencies on that basis which makeseverything deterministic and repeatablewhile we're at it we also use AMD'ssmart shift technology and send anyunused power from the CPU to the GPU soit can squeeze out a few more pixels thebenefits of this strategy are quitelarge running a GPU at two gigahertz waslooking like an unreachable target withthe old fixed frequency strategy withthis new paradigm we're able to run wayover that in fact we have to cap the GPUfrequency at two point two threegigahertz so that we can guarantee thatthe on chip logic operates properly 36cuse at two point two three gigahertz isten point three teraflopsand we expect the GPU to spend most ofits time at or close to that frequencyand performancesimilarly running the CPU at 3 gigahertzwas causing headaches with the oldstrategy but now we can run it as highas 3.5 gigahertz in fact it spends mostof its time at that frequency thatdoesn't mean all games will be runningin 2.2 3 gigahertz and 3.5 gigahertzwhen that worst case game arrives itwill run at a lower clock speed but nottoo much lower to reduce power by 10% itonly takes a couple of percent reductionin frequency so I'd expect any downclocking to be pretty minor all thingsconsidered the change to a variablefrequency approach will show significantgains for PlayStation gamers the finalof our three principals was aboutfinding new dreams it's important for uson the hardware team to find new ways toexpand or deepen gaming and that's whatled us to a focus on 3d audio as playerswe experience the game through thevisuals through audio and through thefeedback we received from the controllersuch as Rumble or haptics personally Ifeel a game is just dead without audiovisuals are of course important but theimpact of audio is huge as well at thesame time the audio team on a gameproject has to do a lot with a littlefor example on PlayStation 4 there'sfierce competition for the Jaguar CPUcores audio typically ends up gettingjust a fraction of a core that's notmuch of a computational resourceparticularly when you consider that thevisuals run at 30 or 60 frames a secondbut audio processing needs to happen atalmost 200 times a second so it's beentough going making forward progress onaudio with Playstation 4particularly when PlayStation 3 was sucha beast when it came to audio the SPU'sand cell were almost a perfect devicefor audio rendering simple pipelinealgorithms could really take advantageof asynchronous DMA and frequentlyreached a hundred percent utilization ofthe floating-point unit there'sunfortunately nothing comparable onPlayStation 4 probably the most dramaticprogress in the PlayStation 4 generationhas been with Virtual Reality the PSBare hardhas its own audio unit it supports aboutfifty pretty decent 3d sound sources andthis provided a hint as to where wecould go with audio as well as somevaluable experience not to oversimplifybut here were our goals for audio onPlayStation 5 the first goal was greataudio for everyone not just VR users orsound bar owners or headphone users thatmeant audio had to be part of theconsoleit couldn't be a peripheral the secondgoal was to support hundreds of soundsources we didn't want developers tohave to pick and choose what soundswould get 3d effects and which wouldn'twe wanted every sound in the game tohave dimensionality and finally wewanted to really take on the challengesof presence and locality now when we saypresence we mean the feeling that you'reactually there you've entered the matrixit's not of course something we thoughtwe could perfectly achieve but the ideawas that if we stopped using just a rainsound and instead use lots of 3d audiosources for raindrops hitting the groundat all sorts of locations around youthen at some point your brain would takea leap and you'd begin to have thisfeeling this feeling of real presenceinside the virtual world of the gamethis has the capacity to affect yourappreciation of the game just like musicin a game does the concept of localityis simpler it's just your sense of wherethe audio is coming from to the right ofyou behind you above you this canimmerse you further in the game and itcan also directly enhance the gameplayto use dead space as an example I knowold school you're fighting enemies infairly dark spooky locations back in theday if you played the game using the TVspeakers you could tell that there wasone last enemy growling and hunting youdown but it was difficult to tell quitewhere that enemy was with headphones youcan tell that the enemy was somewhere onthe right which lets you deduce if youcouldn't see it that it must besomewhere behind and to your right butwith 3d audio with good locality theidea is you know the enemy is preciselythere and you turn and you take it outso how do we know where a sound iscoming from in the first place well allthose bumps and folds in the ear have ameaning evolutionarily speaking based onwhat direction the sound is coming fromsound waves bounce around inside the earthere's some constructive anddestructive interference and the resultis a change in volume the phase of thesound also shifts depending on what paththe sound wave took to reach the earcanal these volume changes and phaseshifts are different for each directionand also vary depending on the frequencyof the sound head size and head shapealso impact the sound in a similarfashion the way that the sound changesbased on direction and frequency can beencoded in a table called the headrelated transfer function or HR TFhere's part of one the vertical axis isthe frequency the horizontal axis is thedirection front back left right and thecolor gives the degree of attenuation ofthe sound at that frequency the HRT F isas unique to an individual as afingerprint is in fact you're looking atmine right now here is how we measure inh RTF we've taken hundreds of peoplethrough this process we put a microphonein the subjects left and right earcanals and then sit the subject down inthe middle of an array of 22 speakers wethen play an audio sweep from eachspeaker as we rotate the subject in thecourse of ten or twenty minutes we'reable to sample the H RTF at over 1,000locations using an H RTF when renderingaudio creates unparalleled quality butit's computationally expensive thesimplest way to use an H RTF is toprocess a sound source to make it appearas if it's coming from one of thosethousand locations we sampleunfortunately the processing has to bedone in frequency domain rather thantime domain so there's multiple fastFourier transforms needed for everysound source for every audio tech that'sa lot of multiplies this computationalcomplexity was the determining factorfor our strategy Ament we had to bitethe bullet and design and build a customhardware unit for 3d audio collectivelywe're referring to the hardware unit andthe proprietary algorithms we run on ittempest 3d audio Tech the meaning of 3daudio and technology should be prettyobvious hereas for tempest I feel it really reflectsour goals with audio it suggests acertain intensity of experience and alsohints at your presence within it we'recalling the hardware unit that we builtthe tempest engine it's based on AMD'sGPU technology we modified a computeunit in such a way as to make it veryclose to the SPU is in PlayStation 3remember when I said that they wereideal for audio so the tempest enginehas no caches just like an SPU all dataaccess is via DMA just like an SPU ourtarget was that it would have more powerthan a CPU thanks to the parallelismthat a GPU can achieve and then it wouldbe more efficient than our GPU thanks tothe SPU like architecture the goal beingto make possible near 100% utilizationof the C use vector units where we endedup is a unit with roughly the same sim Dpower and bandwidth as all eight Jaguarcores in the PlayStation 4 combined ifwe were to use the same algorithms aspsvr that's enough for something like5,000 sound sources but of course wewant to use more complex algorithms andwe don't need anything like that numberof sounds it would have been wonderfulif a simpler strategy such as usingDolby Atmos peripherals could haveachieved our goals but we wanted 3daudio for all not just those withlicensed sound bars or the like also wewanted many hundreds of sound sourcesnot just the 32 that at most supportsand finally we wanted to be able tothrow an overwhelming amount ofprocessing power at the problem and itwasn't clear what any peripheral mighthave inside of it in fact with thetempest enginewe've even got enough power that we canallocate some to the games to the extentthat games want to make use ofconvolution reverb and other algorithmsthat are either computationallyexpensive or need high bandwidth but theprimary purpose of the tempest engineremains 3d audio now 3d audio is a majoracademic research topic it's safe to saythat no one in the worldall of the answers and the set ofalgorithms that has to be invented tunedor implemented to realize our vision for3d audio is immense for example use ofHR TFS in games is quite complex beforeI talked about making a sound sourceappear as if it's coming from one ofthose thousand HR TF sample locationsbut for high quality 3d game audio wehave to handle other possibilities thesound source might not be at one of thethousand HR TF sample locations so wehave to blend the HR TF data from theclosest locations that we have sampledthe sound source might be moving whichneeds very special handling as thatblend keeps changing and that can causephase artifacts in the resulting audioor the sound source might have a size toit meaning it should feel as if it'scoming from an area rather than a singlepoint there's also whole categories ofapproaches to be handled 3d audio can beimplemented using individual processingof 3d sound sources but alternativelyambisonics can be used for 3d audioambisonics speak somewhat like thespherical harmonics used in computergraphics and finally there's audiodevices the player might be usingheadphones or TV speakers or have ahigher end surround sound set up withsix or more speakers all of which needdifferent approaches that's a lot ofvariations it's nice to have thecomputational resources of the tempestengine but it's clear that achieving ourultimate goals with 3d audio is going tobe a multi-year step-by-step processhaving said that headphone audioimplementation is largely complete atthis time it was a natural place for usto start with headphones we controlexactly what each ear hears andtherefore the algorithmic developmentand implementation are morestraightforward for TV speakers andstereo speakers were in the process ofimplementing virtual surround sound theidea being that if you're sitting in asweet spot in front of the TV then thesound can be made to feel as if it'scoming from any direction even behindyouvirtual surround sound has a lot incommon with 3d audio on headphones butit's more complex because the left earcan hear the right speaker andvice-versa we have a basicimplementation of virtual surroundup and running we're now looking atincreasing the size of that sweet spotwhich is to say making the area you needto be in to feel the 3d effect largerand we're also working to boost thesense of locality headphone audio is thecurrent gold standard for 3d audio onplaystation 5 but we're going to seewhat we can do to bring virtual surroundsound to a similar level after whichwe'll start in on setups with morespeakers such as 6 channel surroundsound it's now to the point where someof the playstation 5 games indevelopment are extensively using thesesystems one of the game demos allows youto toggle between conventionalPlayStation 4 style stereo audio and ournew 3d audio I listened with just anordinary pair of over the Yearheadphones and wow I could feel adifference 3d audio has that dimensionalfeel to it conventional stereo audiofeels smashed flat by comparison theimprovement is obvious so a bigadvancement but have I entered thematrix does my brain believe I'm reallythere like I was talking about earlierwhen I explained our target of presencewell the answer is no but you'veprobably caught on to what's missinghere namely whose HRT F was being usedit wasn't mine it was the default HRT Fthe audio team analyzed the hundredsthat they measured and chose the onethey felt with the closest fit to thetotal game playing audience this shows apiece of the default HRT F on the leftand my HRT F on the right you can seethat the general features are much thesame but the details are quite differentwith the default HRT F as I said the 3daudio sounds pretty great when I use myHRT F though the audio reaches a higherlevel of realism which is to say thatwhen using headphones and my HRT F Ioccasionally get fooled and even think asound is coming from the real world whenit's actually coming from the game acorollary to this is that there are afew people whose HRT FS are sufficientlyfar from the default HRT F that's thered dot here that they can togglebetween ps4 style and PS 5 style audioand not sense much difference I've had afew people describe the playstation 5 3daudio is soundinglike a bit better stereo audiopresumably they're the ones at the veryedges of this diagram which means whatHRT F you're using is key I'd likeeveryone to be able to experience whatI'm experiencing but obviously it's notpossible to measure the HRT F of everyPlayStation user that means HRT Fselection and synthesis are going to bebig topics going forward as the tempesttechnology matures at PlayStation 5launch will be offering a choice of fiveHRT FS there's a simple test where youpick the one that gives you the bestlocality that's just the first stepthough this is an open-ended researchtopic maybe you'll be sending us a photoof your ear and we'll choose a neuralnetwork to pick the closest HRT F in ourlibrary maybe you'll be sending us avideo of your ears and your head andwe'll make a 3d model of them andsynthesize the HRT F maybe you'll playan audio game to tune your HRT F will besubtly changing it as you play and homein on the HRT F that gives you thehighest score meaning that it matchesyou the best this is a journey we'll allbe taking together over the next fewyearsultimately we're committing to enablingeveryone to experience that next levelof realism hopefully I've been able toillustrate a bit about our design anddecision making process today and whyPlayStation 5 has the feature set thatit does now comes the fun part we get tosee how the development community takesadvantage of that feature set I'm hopingfor the completely unexpected will itcome from audio ray-tracing thecapabilities of the SSD or somethingelse I guess we'll find out soon enoughthank you for your time today

[Music]what's up guys just again tech here andthis right here is a brand new samsunggalaxy watch 5. in this video i'll becomparing the new galaxy watch 5 withthe galaxy watch 4. the samsung galaxywatch 5 is the latest addition to thesamsung smartwatch lineup whereas thegalaxy watch 4 is one of the bestselling smart watches i'll be comparingboth these smart watches in three keyareas design and display battery lifeand price and fitness and features and ihope by the end of this video it'll helpyou decide if you should buy this newgalaxy watch 5 or the already discountedgalaxy watch 4. also do note both thesesmart watches are compatible only withandroid devices so with that being saidlet's get startedthe galaxy watch 5 features a minimalistdesign and comes in two sizes 40mm and44mm like this one right here both themodels are available in only one stylewhich is an armored aluminium body the40mm model is available in three colorfinishes black gold and silver whereasthe 44mm model comes in black silver anda beautiful blue finish which isprobably the best color in my opinion incomparison the galaxy watch 4 is alsoavailable in the same two sizes 40 mmand a larger 44 mm size like this oneright here and the galaxy watch 4 alsofeatures the same armor aluminum bodyhas the watch 5. the 40mm model isavailable in black silver and gold andthe 44mm model is available in blacksilver and green aside from the colorsif you look at the watches next to eachother they look exactly the same theonly minor difference which hardlyanyone will notice is that the galaxywatch 5 has a more curvier back comparedto the watch 4 which helps for betterskin contact to get accurate resultseven though both these smart watchesfeature the same armor aluminium bodythey have a minor difference in weightthe 40 mm galaxy watch 4 weighs around26 grams and the 44 mm model weighsapproximately 30.3 grams in comparisonthe galaxy watch phi weighs a bit moreas it houses a larger battery the 40 mmmodel weighs 28.7 grams and the 44 mmmodel weighs 33.5 grams i have won boththe models and they both provide a verycomfortable fit so the slight differencein weight shouldn't be a huge issue inorder to set up both these smartwatchesall you got to do is download the galaxyvariable app on your android phone andthen turn on the watch by pressing boththe buttons on the watch and after thatall you have to do is just open up theapp and select the device you want toconnect to and then just follow theon-screen instructions once the watch isset up and ready to use you can accessall the watch features and settings fromthe app both the galaxy watch 5 andgalaxy watch 4 are equipped with a superamoled touch screen display thatsupports 396 by 396 resolution on the 40mm model and an amazing 450 by 450 pixelresolution on the 44 mm model thedisplay itself is sharp multicolored andlooks really nice and it makeseverything on the watch face easy toread the one minor difference in termsof display is that the galaxy watch 5display features a new sapphire crystallens which offers a 60 more harder outerlayer compared to watch 4 to wake up thedisplay on both the watches just raiseyour arm or press any physical buttonand then you can see the watch face thedisplay goes off as soon as you loweryour hand and this is actually good asit saves your battery both the watchesalso support always on display option onall watch faces which makes sure you cansee the screen or watch face at alltimes the digital rotating bezel on thegalaxy watch 5 and the galaxy watch 4 iswhat makes these samsung watches uniquewhen compared to any other smartwatchthe black border around the display ofthe galaxy watch 4 and 5 is a digitalbezel that lets you scroll through menusor widgets which is a really nicefeature to have as it makes navigatingacross the ui very easy it isn't asconvenient as a physical bezel but onceyou get a hang of it you shouldn't haveany issues as both the smartwatches havea touchscreen display you can use thetouchscreen features like swiping downto access quick settings or swiping leftto access widgets and swiping right toaccess all your notifications both thesmartwatches have two buttons on theright hand side an oval shaped backbutton and a home button which has a redborder around it pressing the homebutton twice opens up the most recentlyused app and holding it for a fewseconds activates bixby the digitalvoice assistant which you can use forvarious voice only features whereasholding down the back button opens upsamsung pay which can be used for nfcpayments so you can directly pay throughyour watch also if you're wondering whostill uses samsung bixby you can changethe voice assistant on both the watchesto google assistant and reprogram thehome button which makes everything muchbetter you can also find the varioushealth rated sensors at the back of boththe smartwatches which are usedextensively to provide accurate healthand fitness results you can change thewatch face on both the watches byholding down on a particular watch faceor using the respective app on yourphone the samsung galaxy variable appsupports more than 200 watch faces asthey support third party watch faces soyou have n number of options to choosefrom also the watch straps on both thesmart watches can be swapped and changedto any other 20 mm or 22 mm watch strapof your lycang both the smartwatchesalso offer ip68 rating and waterresistance up to a depth of 50 meterswhich means they can handle splashesrain showering and swimmingthe biggest software change for thesamsung smartwatches arrived with thegalaxy watch 4 has all the smartwatchesfrom galaxy watch 4 series including thenew galaxy watch 5 run on google wear osinstead of samsung tizen os samsung usesits own one ui watt skin in the watchesbut the whole os is based on google wearos 3. the whole os feels good and reallysmooth with no lags or bugs anywhere itis an amazing improvement over thesamsung tizen os the new galaxy watch 5ships with one ui watch 4.5 whichsupports new accessibility features andimproved typing experience as googlewear os gives you access to the googleplay store you pretty much have accessto all third party apps you need forexample a third party youtube player appthat lets you play a youtube video oryoutube music and spotify for all yourmusic content or apps like nike runningand strava to track your workouts or thecalm app to relax your mind google whereos opens up a whole new world for thirdparty app support and if you're someonewho is upgrading from galaxy watch 3this will make you very happy like anyother smartwatch both these smartwatchesalert you when you're getting a phonecall and let you swipe to accept it orreject it the speaker and the microphonequality on both these smart watches isreally good i have taken calls throughboth the smartwatches and the caller atthe other hand had no problem in hearingmy voice both the watches also supportlte or cellular connectivity which meansyou'll be able to handle calls send andreceive messages and stream music fromyour apps etc without having to be nearyour phone or rely on bluetooth thesmart watches also alert you when youget messages and notifications fromdifferent apps on your phone and you canreply to those messages from your watchitself both the galaxy watches give youan amazing interactive experience as youcan use the reply back features for withalmost every app both the smart watchesare designed for fitness heart sleep andstress tracking both galaxy watchesfeature samsung's three in one bioactivesensor which includes ecg bioelectricalimpedance sensor and a heart rate sensorwhich helps monitor heart rate bloodoxygen levels body composition and sleepwith the body composition reading youcan now have a rough idea of your musclemass and body fat percentage which ispretty good and helpful the heart ratemonitor is accurate and you can alsolink it to third party apps like stravaadidas running and nike running clubalso do note some of these healthrelated features like ecg are availableonly when connected to samsung phonesboth the smartwatches can track over 100different workouts with automaticactivity tracking functionality whichmeans the watch will immediately startrecording a workout session when itdetects a certain spike in your activitythis is really helpful in scenarioswhere you just take the stairs to workor when you're cycling or jogging backfrom college to your home they alsotrack the vo2 max data which lets youknow how much oxygen is being usedduring your workouts the galaxy watch 5does have a few new tricks up its sleeveit features a new infrared temperaturesensor with samsung plans to use fortemperature monitoring which could behelpful to detect early fever orsickness science unfortunately it stillisn't active and samsung says it will beavailable in the near future also thegalaxy watch 5 supports improved sleeptracking as it features a new sleepcoaching program that guides you toimprove your sleep habits other thanthese two new features both thesewatches offer the same in terms offitnessthe galaxy watch 4 features a 247milliampere battery for the 40 mm modeland a 361 mah battery for the 44 mmmodel the watch 4 on heavy usage lastsyou around 15 hours and i used to chargeit before i hit the bed but in moderateuse it should last you 25 to 26 hours incomparison the new galaxy watch 5features a bigger battery and samsungclaims it supports 40 to 50 hours ofbattery life but unfortunately that'snot true the galaxy watch 5 40 mm modelpacks 284 mah battery whereas the 44 mmmodel is packed with a 410 mah batterywhich are good improvements over thegalaxy watch 4. the galaxy watch 5 onheavy usage with always on displaygoogle assistant enabled calls workoutsand gps navigation lasted me almost aday under moderate use it should lastyou for at least 30 to 32 hours alsothis estimate is completely based on myusage and it can be even lower if you doconsider the lte model compared to thewatch 4 galaxy watch 5 has fastercharging and can charge your watch to 35under 30 minutes and it takes you around2 hours to charge from 0 to 100 thegalaxy watch 5 is definitely moreexpensive than the watch 4 as it is thelatest addition to the samsung watchlineup the 40mm bluetooth model costsyou 279 us dollars and the 44mmbluetooth model costs you 309 us dollarsthe 44mm lte model costs you 329 usdollars and the 44mm lte model costs you359 us dollars in india the bluetoothversion retails for 30 000 indian rupeesand the lda model retails for around 35000 indian rippers in comparison the 40mm bluetooth version of the watch 4costs you 199 us dollars and the 44 mmbluetooth version costs you around 229us dollars the 40 mm lte model costs you249 us dollars and the 44 mm lte modelcosts you 279 us dollars in india thebluetooth version retails for 18 000indian rippers and the lte model retailsfor around 28 000 indian rupees but thegalaxy watch 4 is already discounted andyou can get it for a much cheaper pricelinks to a few new discounted prices areprovided in the description so now thati have gone over everything that theseboth smartwatches have to offer thequestion is which smartwatch should youbuy should you pay more and get the newgalaxy watch 5 or should you just buythe discounted galaxy watch 4. eventhough the galaxy watch 5 is new it isjust a very minor iterative update overthe galaxy watch 4 and it does not offeranything fancy or extraordinary thatwill make you regret buying the galaxywatch 4. the most noticeable upgrades onthe galaxy watch 5 is the new infraredtemperature sensor which still isn'tactive a better battery life moredurable sapphire crystal glass and newcolors which really doesn't convince meto recommend this over the discountedgalaxy watch 4. the samsung galaxy watch4 offers almost everything that thegalaxy watchful does and it is anamazing watch that you can buy eventhough the watch 5 is just a minorupdate over the watch 4 both thesewatches are still the best android smartwatches you can buy right now and theonly real competition could be theupcoming google pixel watch so whicheversmartwatch you choose between the galaxywatch 5 and 4 depending on your budgetyou will certainly enjoy using them sothat's it guys that was the comparisonbetween the brand new samsung galaxywatch 5 and the galaxy watch 4. do letme know down in the comments whichsmartwatch do you prefer all the linksrelated to this video will be down inthe description also don't forget tosmash that like button and subscribe tothe channel if you haven't already mostimportantly thank you for watching andi'll see you guys in the next videountil then take care and stay safe peace

usedduring your workouts the galaxy watch 5does have a few new tricks up its sleeveit features a new infrared temperaturesensor with samsung plans to use fortemperature monitoring which could behelpful to detect early fever orsickness science unfortunately it stillisn't active and samsung says it will beavailable in the near future also thegalaxy watch 5 supports improved sleeptracking as it features a new sleepcoaching program that guides you toimprove your sleep habits other thanthese two new features both thesewatches offer the same in terms offitnessthe galaxy watch 4 features a 247milliampere battery for the 40 mm modeland a 361 mah battery for the 44 mmmodel the watch 4 on heavy usage lastsyou around 15 hours and i used to chargeit before i hit the bed but in moderateuse it should last you 25 to 26 hours incomparison the new galaxy watch 5features a bigger battery and samsungclaims it supports 40 to 50 hours ofbattery life but unfortunately that'snot true the galaxy watch 5 40 mm modelpacks 284 mah battery whereas the 44 mmmodel is packed with a 410 mah batterywhich are good improvements over thegalaxy watch 4. the galaxy watch 5 onheavy usage with always on displaygoogle assistant enabled calls workoutsand gps navigation lasted me almost aday under moderate use it should lastyou for at least 30 to 32 hours alsothis estimate is completely based on myusage and it can be even lower if you doconsider the lte model compared to thewatch 4 galaxy watch 5 has fastercharging and can charge your watch to 35under 30 minutes and it takes you around2 hours to charge from 0 to 100 thegalaxy watch 5 is definitely moreexpensive than the watch 4 as it is thelatest addition to the samsung watchlineup the 40mm bluetooth model costsyou 279 us dollars and the 44mmbluetooth model costs you 309 us dollarsthe 44mm lte model costs you 329 usdollars and the 44mm lte model costs you359 us dollars in india the bluetoothversion retails for 30 000 indian rupeesand the lda model retails for around 35000 indian rippers in comparison the 40mm bluetooth version of the watch 4costs you 199 us dollars and the 44 mmbluetooth version costs you around 229us dollars the 40 mm lte model costs you249 us dollars and the 44 mm lte modelcosts you 279 us dollars in india thebluetooth version retails for 18 000indian rippers and the lte model retailsfor around 28 000 indian rupees but thegalaxy watch 4 is already discounted andyou can get it for a much cheaper pricelinks to a few new discounted prices areprovided in the description so now thati have gone over everything that theseboth smartwatches have to offer thequestion is which smartwatch should youbuy should you pay more and get the newgalaxy watch 5 or should you just buythe discounted galaxy watch 4. eventhough the galaxy watch 5 is new it isjust a very minor iterative update overthe galaxy watch 4 and it does not offeranything fancy or extraordinary thatwill make you regret buying the galaxywatch 4. the most noticeable upgrades onthe galaxy watch 5 is the new infraredtemperature sensor which still isn'tactive a better battery life moredurable sapphire crystal glass and newcolors which really doesn't convince meto recommend this over the discountedgalaxy watch 4. the samsung galaxy watch4 offers almost everything that thegalaxy watchful does and it is anamazing watch that you can buy eventhough the watch 5 is just a minorupdate over the watch 4 both thesewatches are still the best android smartwatches you can buy right now and theonly real competition could be theupcoming google

Such Amazing Screen Witch Crisp Colours. More Internal Storage (64gb) . Also Amazing Redesigned Dock With LAN Port. Also Love The Red And Blue Joy Cons . I Will Consider Getting It .

This have the best display quality out of all nintendo switches

Very happy with the product and quick delivery!

Excellent product received as per schedule

This is my second nintendo console after the Gameboy color which i had way back in 2003..i switched to playstation after that due to availability of games in india.Coming to this console... I kept a track on its pricing for months i got this 27999 for V.R Games seller.. Make sure u choose this coz they are the official importers of the switch.. So i got for almost the same price as in US which is 350$-The packaging of the product was excellent. It was fully sealed wrapped in plastic and it had the official nintendo seal sticker so no complaints there-The console i received is from Singapore region so the charger is round tip which fits perfectly in Indian power outlets no need adapter.-the best part of this console is that vivid OLED display, the colour are vibrant and blacks are spot on.- the battery depends on the types of games u play. I got aroun 3:30min playin assassins creed black flag.. And almost 4:30 min on playing pokemon brilliant diamond. Both games wer played at 50% brightness.- it runs at 720p on handheld mode.. But once its docked it goes to 1080p.. 720p on the oled screen looks great.Some tips-install a tempered screen protector immediately.. This screen gets scratches easily.. I have used the spigen screen protector it comes with an easy applicator.-if you want to use the Eshop create a nintendo account on the nintendo website on ur pc or mobile and in edit profile set your region to America.. Choose any state.-link ur debit card to paypal to purchase online. I hav a canara bank card which is linked to paypal and it works on the Eshop.

Good genuine product

In other reviews as well as in the product photos the red and blue color are dark but for me, they are like neon red (which is kind of pinkish) but the blue is kinda of close enough as it should be, really disappointed with the red color, if I had known this would happen then I would have purchased the white one only, please look forwardto this. Other then that the games are pretty smooth and a lot of free games

Nice crisp OLED displayAwesome games

If you have played mario in the eighties and the nineties and liked it, just go for it if you can afford it. Forget the reviews, forget the endless youtubers comparing the graphics capabilities of consoles, what matters is what you want to play on the console. If it is mario and the likes, just go for it. You cannot play it on any other console with whatever it's capabilities are !!Also if you want to enjoy gaming yourselves and with kids, nintendo switch is the most kid friendly console. You will struggle to find non 18+ games for xbox and ps5. Also as Nintendo is the oldest gaming and console company around, the console and controller are bug free and never hangs or disconnect. My earlier xbox controller is so useless that it keeps disconnecting due to the vibrations of the haptic feedback itself, that I had to disable vibrations in order to use it. It still keeps disconnecting.Only affordability and price of games is an issue here. So if you have money to throw away, go for it otherwise save your money and wait for the prices to come down.
